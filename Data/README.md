# Data

## This folder contains raw data, cleaned data, and even triplet data for colbert.

Each folder is named based on the respective raw data that was scraped.

All our data cleaned and polished can be grabbed from the **'final_final.pkl'**. Unseralize and use as you see fit. 

We created triplet data for fine-tuning colbert (hence the annotations.txt files in the raw documents) the triplet pairs can be found in colbertv2.0 (Although we did not have sufficient data to have a higher performance when compared to our clustering approach, thus was not used for the report).
