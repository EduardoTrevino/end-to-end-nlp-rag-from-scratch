29	April 10, 2019  Buggy Races Keep Rolling at Carnegie Mellon  In its 99th year, the tradition is a Spring Carnival treat  By Heidi Opdyke  Sweepstakes, also known as the Buggy Races, has come a long way at Carnegie Mellon University. The slick, torpedo-like vessels carrying drivers with nerves of steel are a far cry from the two-man teams that once changed places halfway through a race and rode in everything from rain barrels with bicycle wheels to three-wheeled ash cans 99 years ago.  Today, it takes six people to maneuver the .84 -mile course around Schenley Park's Flagstaff Hill.  But while five pushers and a driver navigate the course's hills, dozens of people are needed to make a successful race happen. A year of planning goes into just over two minutes of racing.

57	Learn at LTI The LTI's degree programs draw from a common set of courses and core skills, but emphasize different types of expertise that prepare you for a wide range of career options. All of our programs provide the hands-on experience and rigorous curriculum that are the hallmark of computer science at Carnegie Mellon. Program Type: Master's Programs Program Name: Master of Computational Data Science (MCDS) Overview: The MCDS degree focuses on engineering and deploying large-scale information systems. Our comprehensive curriculum equips you with the skills and knowledge to develop the layers of technology involved in the next generation of massive information system deployments and analyze the data these systems generate. When you graduate, you’ll have a unified vision of these systems from your core courses; internship experience; and semester-long, group-oriented capstone project. MCDS graduates are sought-after software engineers, data scientists and project managers at leading information technology, software services and social media companies. Requirements: The MCDS program offers three majors: Systems, Analytics, and Human-Centered Data Science. All three require the same total number of course credits, split among required core courses, electives, data science seminar and capstone courses specifically defined for each major. The degree can also be earned in two different ways, depending on the length of time you spend working on it. Regardless of the timing option, all MCDS students must complete a minimum of 144 units to graduate. Here are the options: Standard Timing — a 16-month degree consisting of study for fall and spring semesters, a summer internship, and fall semester of study. Each semester comprises a minimum of 48 units. This timing is typical for most students. Students graduate in December. Extended Timing — a 20-month degree consisting of study for fall and spring semesters, a summer internship, and a second year of fall and spring study. Each semester comprises a minimum of 36 units. Students graduate in May. For a complete overview of the MCDS requirements, visit the MCDS website or read the MCDS Handbook. Curriculum: To earn an MCDS degree, student must pass courses in the core curriculum, the MCDS seminar, a concentration area and electives. Students must also complete a capstone project in which they work on a research project at CMU or on an industry-sponsored project. In total, students must complete 144 eligible units of study, including eight 12-unit courses, two 12-unit seminar courses and one 24-unit capstone course. Students must choose at minimum five core courses. The remainder of the 12-unit courses with course numbers 600 or greater can be electives chosen from the SCS course catalog. Any additional non-prerequisite units taken beyond the 144 units are also considered electives. MCDS students must also pass the undergraduate course 15-513 Introduction to Computer Systems (6 units), typically in the summer before their program commences. The student must pass with a grade of B- or better. Failure to pass the course means that the student takes 15-213 during either the fall or spring semester. Note that in both cases the units do not count toward the 144 eligible units of study. Click here to see the MCDS Course Map. Some example courses of study are included below.

58	Carnegie Technical Schools   At one point the richest man in the world, Carnegie believed that "to die rich is to die disgraced." He turned his attention to writing, social activism and philanthropy, determined to establish educational opportunities for the general public where few existed. In 1900, he donated $1 million for the creation of a technical institute for the city of Pittsburgh, envisioning a school where working-class men and women of Pittsburgh could learn practical skills, trades and crafts that would enhance their careers, lives and communities. "My heart is in the work," he stated, which would become part of the school's official motto. The Carnegie Technical Schools offered two- and three-year certificates in the arts as well as in engineering disciplines and included a college for women, Margaret Morrison Carnegie College. 
59	An MCDS student must complete 144 units, including eight 12-unit courses, two 12-unit seminar courses, one 24-unit capstone course, and pass the undergraduate course 15-513 with a grade of B- or better.

"Members of Fringe, celebrating their 50th year of Buggy racing, allowed a rare visit into its shop for a behind-the-scenes tour."  "Dave Singh explains how Fringe builds its buggies. Each team keeps its actual processes a secret, but each buggy has certain features such as a body, pushbar, wheels and driving and braking mechanisms. Behind Singh are other buggies built by Fringe." 
67	The MLT program integrates research through required research in both summers, directed research during the academic years under the guidance of faculty advisors, and the option to complete a thesis.
68	Items featuring the official tartan pattern can be found in the University Store.

74	The Machine  The basics of a buggy are straightforward, but teams are often secretive in how they build the machines, in particular the way they brake, steer and what types of wheels are used.  Each has a body, pushbar for runners to move the machine up the hills, wheels, a safety harness and driving and braking mechanisms. Some also include fairings, a type of housing around the wheels that help reduce drag, make the vehicle quieter and just looks cool.  Fairings have been a key feature for the Fringe team in recent years, which is celebrating its 50th anniversary of Buggy.  "We have a reputation of being the quietest on the course," said Diya Nuxoll, who wrapped up her bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering in December and is working on an advanced studies master's degree in design and manufacturing. Nuxoll leads the Fringe team as one of two head mechanics.  This year Fringe is planning to roll four different vehicles, built and maintained in the Fringe workshop in the basement of the East Campus Garage, known as the "Froom."  "We're used to saying everything with 'fr' in front of it but when we say something in front of other people, it gets them confused," said Fringe head mechanic Dave Singh, who will graduate in May with a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering and biomedical engineering.  Fringe vehicles often are named with the letter "B," like Boson, Blueshift, Bissa and Bumper. Other teams, such as Apex, often use names that connotate fire, while the SDC (Student Dormitory Committee) team, uses names such as Vice, Bane, Avarice and Malice.  This year's buggy names will be under wraps until Thursday, when the Buggy Showcase will take place from noon to 2 p.m. in Weigand Gymnasium in the Cohon University Center. It's one of the few times spectators can see buggies up close.
75	The arrangement of colored threads in a tartan is identical in both the warp and the weft, ensuring that each stripe of the warp crosses every stripe of the weft at equal intervals.
76	Cardinal and Gray.
77	Requirements include GRE scores, proof of English language proficiency, official transcripts, a current resume, a statement of purpose, three letters of recommendation, and a short video response to a prompt question.
78	Carnegie Mellon has been established for 115 years.
79	University Athletic Association (UAA) Presidents' Athletic Conference for Football only.
80	Behind the Wheel  Drivers, have the closest connection to the vehicles, aside from the mechanics who spent countless hours building and maintaining individual buggies. While races are brief, each driver must log a number of practice runs to qualify to race. Teams practice nights and weekends throughout the fall and spring semesters as weather permits. Buggies are often built around drivers, so the fit can be snug, and drivers are often less than 5 feet, 3 inches in height. Most — but not all — are women.  Tishya Girdhar, a junior in neuroscience, is social chair for Fringe. She came to CMU wanting to drive, but first she had to get over being claustrophobic. She started as a mechanic and got behind the wheel for last year's Sweepstakes.  "Our team's philosophy is to teach everyone how to do everything," Girdhar said. "But I came to CMU wanting to drive. I wanted to drive so badly."  Safety is a top priority for teams. All drivers are required to have five pieces of safety gear: mouth guard, goggles, a harness that includes three points of contact to the body of the buggy, gloves and a helmet. And during practice runs and races, flaggers man the course to let drivers know if it's safe to proceed.  The streets of the race course haven't changed, but the condition of the course varies due to potholes, which can make or break a fast run. The last course records were set in 2017, but this year potholes are making for some challenging conditions, said Amy Chen, a senior in psychology who has been driving for four years.  With the vehicles just inches from the ground, "even poorly filled potholes makes it dangerous to drive," she added.  Depending on Friday and Saturday's conditions, most heats may run just two lanes instead of three. But still, despite some of the challenges, Chen said she wouldn't miss it.  "Being a driver is really fun," Chen said. "I love going fast and going around the course."
81	Carnegie Tech – Early Years   Soon faced with the demand for baccalaureate programs, Carnegie Technical Schools began offering bachelor's degrees through its College of Engineering and College of Fine Arts, becoming the Carnegie Institute of Technology, or "Carnegie Tech." During the first half of the 20th century, with support from Andrew Carnegie and other funders, Carnegie Tech laid the foundation for a school on the cutting edge. Some key developments were:  It expanded from two buildings into an elegant 20th century campus designed in the beaux arts architectural style, housing a wealth of machine shops, studios and laboratories — the hands-on center of learning that persists today. It pioneered conservatory degree programs in music and drama, in addition to visual art and design programs. The first U.S. drama degree was awarded in 1914 at Carnegie Tech. It began offering graduate degrees. In 1919, the first doctorate (in civil engineering) was awarded to Mao Yisheng, a student from China. It laid the groundwork for a research institution, recruiting leading scientists, offering sponsored fellowships with government and industry leaders and pioneering nontraditional interdisciplinary research, which brought together physicists, chemists and metallurgists, for example. Interdisciplinary research would become the hallmark of Carnegie Mellon research. It initiated the 'Carnegie Plan' in 1938, a new curriculum that required science and engineer students to take courses in humanities and social sciences in order to better understand the needs of society. Carnegie died in 1919, but his vision for an educated public lived on after him. 
82	Fun Fact about Scottish terrier   The Scottish terrier breed is known for its keen, alert and intelligent expression. Its temperament is described as determined and thoughtful while its physical aspects exemplify strength, power and agility in a small package. Many of these traits are also apparent throughout the university, making the Scottish terrier a natural choice for Carnegie Mellon's mascot.

107	A history of SCS For an expanded history of the School of Computer Science and its predecessors at CMU, read "Institutional Memories" in the Summer 2014 issue of The Link magazine. In 2014, the School of Computer Science celebrated its 25th year as a stand-alone college within Carnegie Mellon University. It was arguably the first college devoted solely to computer science in the United States, and a model for others that followed. But CMU’s computer science era begins much earlier—in 1956, with the arrival of an IBM 650 computer on the campus of what was then known as Carnegie Institute of Technology. The IBM 650 had magnetic-drum memory and a processing speed of approximately 60 instructions per second. Herb Simon (H’90), associate dean of the Graduate School of Industrial Administration—now known as CMU’s Tepper School of Business—established Carnegie Tech’s first Computation Center with the help of its first director, Alan Perlis (S’42).  First freshman-level computer science course In 1956 and 1957, Simon, Allen Newell (IA’57) and Cliff Shaw of RAND designed the Logic Theorist, a computer program that could develop proofs for theorems in much the same way a human would work. They also developed linked-list data structures, the foundation of computer programming. Perlis, Simon and Newell are credited with defining the term “computer science” as “the theory and design of computers,” as well as (in Newell’s words) “the study of the phenomena arising from them.” In 1958, Perlis began teaching the first freshman-level computer programming course in the United States at Carnegie Tech.  Computer science Ph.D. program created In 1961, the Computation Center and its newest computer, a Bendix G-20, were moved to recently completed Scaife Hall. That same year, Carnegie Tech created an interdisciplinary Ph.D. program called Systems and Communications Sciences, combining elements of computer science, mathematics, psychology, business and electrical engineering. The university’s first computer science Ph.D.s were graduates of this program.  Computer Science Department established In 1965, Carnegie Tech established its Computer Science Department, or CSD, with a $5 million grant from the R.K. Mellon Foundation. Perlis was the first department head. There were no undergraduates; only Ph.D. students were admitted, and the department’s focus was on research, much of it funded by the federal government through the Defense Department’s Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA. In 1967, Carnegie Institute of Technology merged with the nearby Mellon Institute of Industrial Research to form Carnegie-Mellon University. The Department of Computer Science moved into the newly created Mellon Institute of Science, later renamed Mellon College of Science, or MCS. Future SCS dean Raj Reddy joined the CSD in 1969 after three years as an assistant professor at Stanford. He brought with him research in speech, language and computer vision. But in 1970 and 1971, the new Computer Science Department faced its first crisis, as half of its tenured faculty members—including department head Perlis—left for other universities. Joe Traub was recruited from Bell Labs to CMU to become the new department head.  Multi-processor machines emerge CSD emerged from the brief crisis as a highly agile, interdisciplinary entity, with many new faculty members taking joint appointments with other CMU departments. Several large projects emerged in the Computer Science Department, including C.mmp, the first shared-memory multiprocessor computer, with 16 processing units, and Cm*, a 50-processor computer. These computers were the forerunners of today’s ubiquitous multi-core desktops and laptops.  Turing Awards and a Nobel Prize In 1975, Simon and Newell were awarded the A.M. Turing Award for their work in artificial intelligence. (As of 2014, 12 CMU alumni or faculty have been awarded Turings, sometimes considered the Nobel Prize of computing.) Three years later, Simon received the Nobel Prize in Economics for his work on decision-making theory. As the 1970s progressed, Newell became interested in human-computer interaction, and began a long relationship with Xerox’s Palo Alto Research Center, or PARC, which released the Xerox Alto in 1973. Considered a forerunner to many of the computing environments that followed, Alto featured a graphical-user interface and was among the first commercially available workstations controlled with a mouse. Inspired by Alto, Reddy launched a drive for development of CMU’s own “three-M” machine—a personal workstation with a megabyte of memory, a megapixel display and at least one million instructions per second of processing power.  Launching a Robotics Institute In 1979, an executive at Pittsburgh’s Westinghouse Electric Corp., Tom Murrin, collaborated with Jordan and Reddy to create the Robotics Institute, with Reddy as its first director. By 1982, the Computer Science Department included more than 30 faculty members and 100 graduate students.  The best-wired campus in the world Working with IBM in the early 1980s, the university and the Computer Science Department established another new research frontier: Development of a high-speed computer network that would reach virtually every room on campus, along with a GUI-based computing environment, and providing networked PCs or workstations for 7,000 students, faculty members and employees. Called the Andrew Project, it turned Carnegie Mellon into the best-connected, most-wired university in the world—a process Newell called “greening up the campus with computer science.” CMU also became home to a new Software Engineering Institute, funded by the Defense Department, to study computer security and develop best practices in the design of operating systems. Between 1982 and 1985, the amount of sponsored research in the Computer Science Department doubled, from $7.2 million to $15.3 million—more than the other four departments in the Mellon College of Science combined.  A “school of computer science” is proposed Feeling that CSD’s needs were inadequately represented in MCS, CSD head A. Nico Habermann and then-CMU provost Angel Jordan in 1986 wrote a white paper proposing the creation of “a School of Computer Science.” Responding to concerns from the faculty that the change might be taking place too quickly, the university first established a free-floating Department of Computer Science. The experiment, which lasted two years, was an unqualified success. Separately, and also in 1986, the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center was created as a joint effort between CMU, the University of Pittsburgh and Westinghouse Electric Corp.  SCS is officially formed CMU’s Faculty Senate in the fall of 1988 agreed to President Richard Cyert’s plan to elevate the Department of Computer Science to college status. In addition to the Computer Science Department, SCS also incorporated the Robotics Institute, the Center for Machine Translation, and researchers from the Information Technology Center, which had developed Andrew. On Dec. 13, 1988, Cyert (H’89) told faculty and staff that Habermann had been appointed CMU’s first Dean of Computer Science, effective Dec. 1, and that the School of Computer Science would soon begin operations. SCS made its formal debut on Dec. 22, 1988, with a reception in the Wherrett Room of Skibo Hall, CMU’s student union. The official announcement of CMU’s new “graduate School of Computer Science” was made Jan. 3, 1989.  Undergraduate degrees begin For several years, undergraduates interested in computer science pursued an “applied math/CS” bachelor’s degree offered by the Mathematics Department. CSD professor Mary Shaw (CS’72) led CMU’s first effort to design an undergraduate curriculum solely in computer science. She and her colleagues were guided by the Carnegie Plan—guidelines established in 1938 under Carnegie Tech President Robert Doherty (A’40, E’48, H’50), outlining the principles of a sound professional education. Drawing on Shaw’s plan and also on the work of other faculty members, an undergraduate program in computer science was created during the 1989-90 academic year. Seven CS majors were admitted to the program as sophomores. Another 73 undergraduates were admitted in 1990–91. By 1995, there were 401 undergraduates in the School of Computer Science; in fall 2013, more than 600 undergraduates made up about 37 percent of student enrollment at SCS, along with more than 600 master’s degree students.  New departments, new areas of study Along the way, the Center for Machine Translation became the Language Technologies Institute, and other new departments were formed, including the Human-Computer Interaction Institute (1993), the Institute for Software Research (1999), the Machine Learning Department (2006) and the Ray and Stephanie Lane Center for Computational Biology (2009). SCS’s seven degree-granting departments draw faculty and students from a wide variety of disciplines, including engineering, mathematics, social sciences, linguistics and design.  Committed to extending our founders’ vision The School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University enters its second quarter century as a world-leading educational and research institution, embracing all facets of computing. Its graduate programs are consisted ranked with the best in the world by a leading U.S. magazine, while its undergraduate programs are also rated the best in the U.S. by corporate recruiters. In 2013, SCS had 284 faculty members and a total student enrollment of nearly 1,700, including undergraduate, master’s and Ph.D. students, and conducted $124 million in research. Indeed, by itself, the Robotics Institute is the largest university robotics research group in the world, with more than 500 people and more than 100 ongoing research projects. A half-century ago, Perlis, Simon and Newell outlined a vision for computer science. The School of Computer Science at CMU remains committed to continuing and extending their vision in the context of big data and connected computing in the 21st century.

University!  Being in the CMU School of Computer Science (SCS)  is a unique experience because of the size of the school (over 2000 students, staff and faculty),  the quality of its members, the variety of research being conducted, and unparalleled learning  opportunities.  We encourage you to take adva ntage of CMU offerings, both inside and outside  SCS, and also to explore Pittsburgh and southw est Pennsylvania to the extent your schedule  permits.   What you will find is an environm ent that encourages and rewards hard work and  accomplishment.  Pittsburgh has long been an indu strial area whose residents build things.  In  SCS we build things, and you will also.   While this handbook is specific to your academic ex perience in the MSAII program, there are  several other resources and offices graduate students are encouraged to consult during their  tenure at Carnegie Mellon University. Infor mation about The Word, the student handbook, the  Office of Graduate and Postdoc A ffairs, the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs and others are  included in Appendix A of this handbook.  2 Mission, Vision and Philosophy  Carnegie Mellon University will have a transfor mative impact on society through continual  innovation in education, research, creativity, and entrepreneurship.  Our mission is to create a transformative educatio nal experience for students focused on deep  disciplinary knowledge; problem solving; teamwork, leadership, communication, and  interpersonal skills; and pers onal health and well-being.  The university community is committed to (a) at tracting and retaining diverse, world-class  talent; (b) creating a collaborative environment open to the free exchange of ideas, in which  research, creativity, innovation, and entrepreneu rship can flourish; and (c) ensuring individuals  can achieve their full potential.  We encourage our members to impact society in  a transformative way — regionally, nationally,  and globally — by engaging with partners out side the traditional bor ders of the university  campus.  See the full university mission statement .  3 Carnegie Mellon Statement of Assurance  Carnegie Mellon University does not discriminate  in admission, employment or administration  of its programs or activities on the basis of r ace, color, national origin, sex, handicap or  disability, age, sexual orientation, gender identity , religion, creed, ancestry , belief, veteran status  or genetic information. Furthe rmore, Carnegie Mellon University does not discriminate and is  required not to discriminate in violation of fede ral, state or local laws or executive orders. 7   Inquiries concerning the application of and comp liance with this statemen t should be directed  to the university ombudsperson, Carnegie Mellon  University, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh,  PA 15213, telephone 412-268-1018. Obtain genera l information about Carnegie Mellon University  by calling 412-268-2000.  Carnegie Mellon University publishes an annual  campus security and fire safety report  describing the university's security , alcohol and drug, sexual assault and fire safety policies, and  containing statistics about the number and ty pe of crimes committed on the campus, and the  number and cause of fires in campus residence faci lities during the preceding three years. You  can obtain a copy by contacting the Carnegie Mellon Police Department  at 412-268-2323. The  annual security and fire safety re port also is available online at  www.cmu.edu/police/annualreports ..  Information regarding the application of Title  IX, including to admission and employment  decisions, the sexual misconduct grievance proced ures and process, including how to file a  report or a complaint of sex discrimination, how to file a report of sexual harassment, and how  the university responds to su ch reports is available at www.cmu.edu/title-ix . The Title IX  coordinator may be reached at 4615 Forbes Ave, Suite 330, Pittsburgh, PA 15213; 412-268-7125; or  tix@cmu.edu .  4 Carnegie Mellon Code  Students at Carnegie Mellon, because they are members of an academic community dedicated to  the achievement of excellence, are expected to m eet the highest standards of personal, ethical  and moral conduct possible.  These standards require personal  integrity, a commitment to honesty without compromise, as  well as truth without equivocation and a willingne ss to place the good of the community above  the good of the self. Obligations once un dertaken must be me t, commitments kept.  As members of the Carnegie Mellon community , individuals are expected to uphold the  standards of the community in a ddition to holding others accountable for said standards. It is  rare that the life of a student in an academic community can be so private that it will not affect the community as a whole or that the above standards do not apply.  The discovery, advancement, and communicatio n of knowledge are not possible without a  commitment to these standards. Creativity cannot exist without acknowledgment of the  creativity of others. New knowledge cannot be developed without credit  for prior knowledge.  Without the ability to trust that these princ iples will be observed, an academic community  cannot exist.  The commitment of its faculty, staff, and students to these standards contributes to the high  respect in which the Carnegie Mellon degree is he ld. Students must not de stroy that respect by 8   their failure to meet these standards. Stud ents who cannot meet them should voluntarily  withdraw from the university.  The Carnegie Mellon Code can also be found online .  5 University Policies and Expectations  It is the responsibility of each member of the Ca rnegie Mellon community to be familiar with  university policies and guidelines. In addition  to this departmental graduate student handbook,  the following resources are available to assist you in understanding community expectations:  The Word/Student Handbook www.cmu.edu/student-affa irs/theword/index.html     Academic Integrity Policy https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student- and-student-life/academic-integrity.html   University Policies Website www.cmu.edu/policies/   Office of Graduate and Postdoc  Affairs http://www.cmu.edu/gradua te/policies/index.html     Due to the changing nature of conditions and ex pectations surrounding public health and safety  requirements please visit https://www.cmu.edu/coronavirus/  for the most up to date  information.  Please see the Appendix A for additional info rmation about The Word and other university  resources.  6 Academic Calendar  The Academic Calendar can be found at https://www.cmu.edu/hub/calendar/index.html  and  provides information on all deadl ines including registration date s, class start dates, add/drop  deadlines, exam dates and more.  7 School and Departmental Information  The following are key personnel with whom you may  interact during your time at Carnegie  Mellon:   Martial Hebert       Dean, School of Computer Science 9    University Professor   GHC 6105  412-268-5704    hebert@cs.cmu.edu    https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~hebert/      David Garlan Associate Dean for Master’s Programs, SCS Professor TCS 420  garlan@cs.cmu.edu   http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~garlan/academics.htm      C a r o l y n  R o s é        Interim Director, Language Technologies Institute  Professor  GHC 5415   412-268-7130   cprose@cs.cmu.edu   8 MSAII Policies  The Language Technologies Institute (LTI) ha s prepared this statement of policies, program  requirements, guidance, process a nd procedures for students in the M.S. in Artificial Intelligence  and Innovation (MSAII) program. A copy of this handbook is also available online at the  program website .    The University Student guide, The Word, which  details university-wide policies, is also  available online at www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/theword .      Additional resources specific to gr aduate students can be found at  www.cmu.edu/graduate/policies/      8.1 The MSAII Degree  The M.S. in Artificial Intelli gence and Innovation (MSAII) is a professional master's program  offered by the Language Technologies Institute (LTI) in the School of Computer Science at  Carnegie Mellon University. This program seeks to educate students in the innovative use of  artificial intelligence to create practical soluti ons in a wide variety of application areas. As  artificial intelligence matures, th ere is a great need for students who can envision, design, plan  and deliver solutions that integrate AI technolo gies such as deep learning, natural language  processing, robotics and big data analytics into  new applications.  The program stresses both 10   intrapreneurship and entrepreneurship and enco urages students to develop ideas for startups  and for introduction into established companies.  The curriculum is designed for students who have  a strong background in computer science  with interest in in-depth study of AI to ena ble them to develop re al-world applications,  especially in areas to which AI has not yet b een applied. The integrated curriculum includes  coursework and team projects lead ing to a full-semester capstone project to produce a working  prototype.      8.2 Program Contacts  Michael I. Shamos         Director, MSAII      Distinguished Career Professor      G H C  6 7 0 7             shamos@cs.cmu.edu     Amber Vivis   Academic Program Manager, MSAII  TCS 357   412-268-9998   avivis@cs.cmu.edu      Carolyn Penstein Rosé      Interim Director, Language Technologies Institute  Professor  GHC 5415   412-268-7130   cprose@cs.cmu.edu   8.3 The Reasonable Person Principle (RPP)  It is a long-standing and revered principle of the School of Computer Science (SCS) that  members of our community are expe cted to act reasonably, and ther efore we try to keep formal,  written SCS policies to a minimum.  The faculty  do not burden the students with numerous  rules, and, in return, we expect the students to not try to find technical  loopholes that violate  the clear intent of program policies.  In any situa tion not covered by an ex plicit rule, you should  ask yourself how reasonable people would behave  in that situation.  The RPP does not alter  University-wide policies.  8.4 Academic Calendar 11   The Academic Calendar can be found at https://www.cmu.edu/hub/calendar/index.html  and  provides information on all deadl ines including registration date s, class start dates, add/drop  deadlines, exam dates and more.  9 The Language Techno logies Institute  9.1 Working Space for MS Students  Except for restrictions due to COVID, full-time students in the LTI’s MS degree programs on the  Pittsburgh campus have access to a shared working space to create a sense of community and  provide space for working when on campus.  9.2 Photocopies and Printers  Mailboxes, printers, copiers, and other depa rtmental resources are located in GHC 5404  The use of a photocopier requires only a CMU ID card.  The School of Computer Science  provides a number of black-and-white and co lor printers for use by students.  The SCS  Computer Facilities publishes a list of printers online at https://computing.cs.cmu.edu/desktop/printing.  Wh en you send a file to  the print queue, you  may go to any of the listed printers, swipe yo ur CMU ID, and the file will be printed on that  printer.  9.3 Computers for MS Students  Students are expected to provide their own laptop computers that can be used to access  university resources and complete course assignm ents.  Laptops running  Windows, MacOS, and  Linux software are all acceptable.  MS students will be given a CS user id.  A CS us er id is required to use the LTI computer cluster,  department printers, and other SC S services.  The School of Computer Science has a Help  Center located at 4203 GHC.  They can be contacted at help@cs.cmu.edu , extension 8-4231 from  a campus phone, or 412-268-4 231 from an outside line.  MS students will be given access to the LTI’s comp uter cluster on an as-needed basis, to be used  for course assignments, directed study projects, and/or the capstone project.  The LTI cluster  provides storage and computation for projects  involving large datasets and/or lengthy  computation.  12   10 Degree Requirements  MSAII students are expected to complete their degr ee requirements within five consecutive semesters,  fall, spring, summer internship, second fall, second sp ring.  Under exceptional conditions, such as for  medical reasons, a student may be granted a leave of absence.  See Section 11.1.10, below.   Upon  completion of the graduate program degree requirem ents, the degree will be certified by the student’s  academic program in the semester in whic h the student completes the requirements .  10.1 Course Grade and GPA Requirements    To receive the M.S. degree, all students  must take and successfully complete at least 195 units  of coursework . All required Core Courses must be completed with a grade of B or better . For  the Knowledge Area Courses, students must maintain a B average .  No grade lower than C (or  Pass in the case of Pass/No Pass courses) shall be used for credit appli ed toward graduation.   Under SCS policy, only a grade of C or higher will be regarded as a Pass in a Pass/No Pass  course.  No undergraduat e courses count toward the 195-unit requirement.  All Core courses are organized in sequence, and must be taken in the following order:   Artificial Intelligence and Future Markets (11-651) – No prerequisite.   AI Engineering (11-695) – Prerequisite is the co mpletion of 11-651 with a grade of “B” or  better.   LTI Practicum (11-935) – Three credit units for completing the required Internship.   AI Innovation (11-654) – Prereq uisite is the completion of 11- 695 with a grade of “B” or  better.   Capstone (11-699) – Prerequisite is the completion of 11-654 with a grade of “B” or better.   Students are required to repeat any required cour se that they have completed with a grade less  than the required minimum, preferably at the nex t offering. (Please note that Core courses and  Knowledge courses are only offered once per year.) Students will be  allowed to retake a required  course only once.  If a student fails in the second attemp t, he or she will be dropped from the  MSAII program.     If a student fails an elective course, she or he will need to repeat the same or take a substitute  course (equivalent course approved by the Director).     All grades count towards the program QPA, exce pt for repeated courses, in which case the final  grade replaces the previous grade.  Courses taken pass/no pass do not affect the student’s QPA.   However, ONLY ELECTIVE COURSES MAY BE  TAKEN PASS/NO PASS, unless the Provost  directs to the contrary.  Students who do not achieve the required minimum grade in a required  course, who elect to take an “i ncomplete” in a required course, or whose cumulative grade point  average is below a B (3.0), will be placed on academ ic probation. Students on probation are not  eligible to graduate. Students who are placed on academic probation shall receive written   notice of this finding, including a list of meas ures that need to be tak en to be removed from 13   academic probation. A student on academic pr obation for two consecutive semesters may be  dropped from the program.     The MSAII program conducts an academic progress re view at the conclusion of each semester in  order to monitor individual student progress towa rd graduation. Should a student’s effort fall  below the acceptable academic performance and/or fail to meet the sta ndards established by the  MSAII program and Carnegie Mellon Universit y, the student may be dismissed from the  program.  Should a student’s overall QPA drop below 3.0 d uring any given semester, he/she will be placed  on academic probation for the following semester and will be required to improve his/her grades  to no less than overall 3.0 QPA d uring that period. Failure to im prove to an overall 3.0 QPA or  better the following semester may result in termin ation from the program. In addition, a student  who violates policies established by Carnegie  Mellon University may be dismissed from the  program.  After each academic progress revi ew, a student may receive one or  more letters, indicating the  result of the review. Warning letters  are issued for the following cases:  1) Overall QPA below 3.0 (Academic probation)  2) Semester QPA is below 3.0  3) Grade below B in a Core course  4) Academic Integrity Violation (AIV) according to  the university policies.  This includes any  AIV letter received in during the summer preceding matriculation.  A student may be terminated from the program under any of the following circumstances:  a) A student who has received two Academic  Integrity Violation (AIV) letters will  be  terminated.  There are no exceptions  and the Program Director has no discretion over  such a termination as it is an LTI policy.  b) A student who has received one Academ ic Integrity Violation (AIV) letter may  be  terminated by the Program Director if the vi olation is so serious that the student cannot  be allowed to remain in the MSAII Program.  c) A student has received three warning letter s of any type from the MSAII program.  d) A student has been found to have violated a University Policy for which termination is  provided.  An AIV letter or violation of University Poli cy may be appealed pursuant to CMU appeal  procedures.  See Section 4.5.2, be low.  However, a decision to te rminate a student after appeal  because of conditions a), b), c) or d) is not appealable.  10.2 Course Requirements  14   1) Summer Before Entrance   Admitted students are required to take, pa y for, and pass 15-513 Introduction to  Computer Systems OR 11-637 Foundations of Computational Data Science during the  summer prior to their arrival at Carnegie Mellon.  The units earned in these courses are  not counted toward the total number of units required for graduation.  These courses  may be taken pass/no pass, but cannot be dr opped.  A student who drops either course  during the summer will not be permitted to begin the degree program in the fall, but  must retake one of the courses the following summer.   The MSAII course offerings are  available at msaii.cs.cmu.edu/curriculum .  The university’s complete Schedule of  Classes can be found at https://enr-apps.as.cmu.edu/o pen/SOC/SOCServlet/search .  Students are then required to take and su ccessfully complete the courses below:  2) The Core Courses (87 units) - Must be taken in THIS SEQUENCE:    11-651 – AI & Future Markets – (12 units). First  Fall semester.   Only open to MSAII.    17-762 – Law of Computer Technolo gy (12 units). First Fall semester    11-695 – AI Engineering (12 un its).

One more 12-unit AI, ML or NLP course of the student’s choice (with approval of the  Program Director)  In the event that a course is not available, a course covering equivalent material with a  similar degree of difficulty may be substitut ed with the permission of the Director. If a 15   student has already taken an equivalent course and shows proficiency in the subject  area, a more advanced course in the area may be taken in place of these required  courses with permission of the Director.  Graduate students cannot receive credit for  undergraduate courses.          4) Electives:   A minimum of 36 units of SCS courses must be taken.  It is recommended to take one  elective in the first fall semester, one or tw o in the first spring semester, one or two in  the second fall semester and zero or one in the second spring semester.  The courses  below are automatically approved.  A stud ent who wants to take a course not listed  must obtain approval of the Director prior to  registering.  In general, the Director will  approve any graduate SCS course of not more than  12 units.  It is also possible to seek  approval for courses in other Colleges at  CMU.  However, those courses must be  rationally related to an AI career in order to be approved as electives.   11-636 MSAII Independent Study (may be tak en ONCE as an electi ve unless permission  of the Director is obtained)  11-641 Machine Learning for Text Mining  11-642 Search Engines 11-676 Big Data Analytics 11-747 Neural Networks for NLP  11-755 Machine Learning for Signal Processing  11-777 Advanced Multimodal Machine Learning 11-791 Design of Intelligent Information Systems 10-605 Machine Learning with Large Datasets 10-608 Conversational Machine Learning  10-702 Statistical Machine Learning  15-624 Foundations of Cyber-Physical Systems 15-645 Database Systems 15-681 AI: Representation and Problem Solving  15-688 Practical Data Science  16-720 Computer Vision 16-725 Medical Image Analysis 16-772 Sensing and Sensors 16-824 Visual Learning and Recognition  17-637 Web Application Development  17-639 Management of Software Development 17-652 Methods: Deciding What to Design 17-653 Managing Software Development  17-766 Software Engineering for Startups 16   02-604 Fundamentals of Bioinformatics  02-718 Computational Medicine   Independent study (11-636) is encouraged.  The process is that you find a faculty  member willing to supervise your independent study,  assign a number of credits not to  exceed 12, and assign a grade at the end of the study.  Th e faculty member must send  an email to the Director indicating such wi llingness.  You can then register for 11-636.    Courses carrying more than 12 units in a se mester are NOT APPROVED as electives.    Students may take athletics or music or th eatrical performance courses that do not  require work outside of class times.  Ho wever, such courses will NOT count toward  the 195 units required for graduation.  10.2.1  Incomplete Grades   Carnegie Mellon University students are expect ed to complete a course during the academic  semester in which the course was taken. Howeve r, if the instructor agrees, a grade of “I”  (incomplete) may be given when a student has b een unable to complete the work of a course.  However, the work completed up to that date must be of pa ssing quality and the grade of  incomplete provides no undue advantage to that student over other students.   By awarding an “I” grade, an instructor must spe cify the requirements for the completion of the  work and designate a default letter grade in th e event that the student fails to complete the  remaining work.   Students must complete the required course work  by no later than th e end of the following  academic semester or sooner if  required by the instructor.   The instructor must record the permanent cours e grade by the last day of the examination  period of the following semester , or the Registrar will automatica lly assign the default grade.   If further work has not been completed after o ne semester and a default grade is rendered, the  default grade will become the grade of record.  10.2.2  Change of grades and missing grades   If a grade has been assigned in error, it can be  changed to a different  permanent grade. The  procedure for changing a grade is as follows:   Discuss the matter with the course instructor;  provide evidence th at the grade issued was  not the grade earned. 17    If the instructor agrees, the student should contact the prog ram administrator to process  a Change of Grade Form in or der to correct the grade that was issued in error. Generally,  the instructor is the final authority for a course grade.   If a grade has not been assigned, please notify  the course instructor for the completion of  a Missing Grade Form.  10.2.3  Transferring to another program   A student may withdraw from th e MSAII program at any time.  If any requirement for the  MSAII degree has not been met, the degree will  not be awarded.  O ccasionally, students are  accepted into a different degree pr ogram at CMU and transfer to that program.  International  students who do this should ch eck with OIE to ensure that th eir visa is not jeopardized.  10.2.4  Intellectual Property Policy  See http://www.cmu.edu/policies/documents/IntellProp.html .  10.2.5  Teaching Requirements  None.  Students who wish to do  so may apply for teaching assist ant positions for courses in  which they have excelled.  It is important to ensure that the student’s academic responsibilities  are not adversely impacted by a TAship, and vice-versa.  10.3 Advising    10.3.1  Student Advising   Every MSAII student will be assigned an advisor,  normally the Program Director.  Before the  course registration period each semester, students  must meet with their advisor to discuss their  course selection. New students wi ll be given instructions to regist er for their classes during the  summer prior to entrance.     10.3.2  Monitoring Progress   The advisor meets with the student at least twic e a year, providing guidance and monitoring the  student’s overall progress.    10.3.3  Degree Certification   Students who graduate having met all the requ irements for the degree will receive a diploma  stating that they have received a “Master of Science in Artifici al Intelligence and Innovation.” 18   10.4 Internship    Students must obtain an internship during the summer between the first and second years of the  program.  This is a requirement.  An internship will provide stu dents with the opportunity to  apply the knowledge and technical skills learned d uring the first year of the program, to gain  insight into AI and future marke t needs to further their experienc e and develop a strong context  for the second-year concentration coursework.  No rmally the internship wi ll be with an outside  company.  In some circumstances, a student wh o is doing research with  a CMU faculty member  during the summer may request that such  research qualify as an internship.  The internship must involve at le ast two months of full-time work  and must relate to computer  software development and is preferably AI-related.  Students are encouraged to intern with an organiza tion that corresponds to their individual area  of interest and career goals.    All students who secure summer internships must register for three units in 11-935 (LTI  Practicum).  This course can be taken once du ring the program with Pass/Fail and will be  counted toward graduation units.  Internationa l students must apply for Curricular Practical  Training (CPT) for the internship by contacting the Office of International Education (OIE).  To  obtain CPT, students need an offer letter spelling  out employment dates, work hours, and wages  or stipend.  It is the student’s responsibility in 11-935 to give a presentation during the semester  following the internship to a ll current MSAII students detailing the student’s internship  experience.  International students who are in terested in working in  the U.S after graduation are required to  consult with the Office of International Educat ion (OIE) which oversees the OPT registration.   Note: OPT must only be used after students have completed their degree at Carnegie Mellon.   NOTE : Students are personally respon sible for securing a suitable internship.  The Career and  Professional Development Center will assist in their search for counseling, workshops, and  internship opportunity listings in Handshake .  We strongly suggest students begin the  internship search beginnin g in the Fall of your first year. So me internship opportunities have  application deadlines in the Fall,  so by starting your search ea rly, you won't miss out on these  internships.  The Career and Pr ofessional Development Center will assist students with the  internship search, but does not match students with employers; obtaining an internship is the  students’ responsibility.    The following steps are recommended to ensure a successful internship outcome.  Many of the  events below have been modified due to COVID.  September/October    Meet with your advisor to discuss your in terests and plan your internship search.  19    Review the internships of previous students. We also encourage you to speak informally  with second-year students who can offer firs t-hand information about their internships.    Attend the Technical Opportunities Conferenc e (TOC) at Carnegie Mellon for exposure  to potential employers for internships.    November/December    Begin researching organizations and internsh ip opportunities. Pay close attention to  organizations that have established inte rnship programs and their deadlines.    Attend workshops to perfec t your resume, hone your inte rviewing skills, and gain  knowledge about the intern ship search process.   January/February    At this point, you should have a “short list” of organizations at which you would like to  intern. This list can include organizations th at have established internship programs as  well as those that interest you without formal internship programs.   Update your resume with relevant ac ademic projects, coursework, etc.   Begin utilizing your network for internship leads as well as checking organization’s  websites for internships.    Make contact with employers, sending resume s and applications, and initiating internship  interviews in person  or by phone.    Attend Network Nights and talk to alumni  about internship opportunities in their  organization. They are an excellent resourc e for learning more about a particular  organization, career field or employment oppo rtunity. You can find alumni in the Alumni  Directory, Alumni Career Advisor Networ k, and Carnegie Mellon Alumni LinkedIn  Network.   March/April    At this point, you should ha ve secured an internship or be  interviewing with various  organizations.    Prepare a backup plan if your first ch oices of internships do not work out.   Attend relevant Network Nights and Career Fairs at Carnegie Mellon.    If you are an F-1 Visa student, you must apply for CPT.    MSAII students should enroll in 11-935 for three units. You will not have to pay tuition for  this course.    10.5 Employment Eligibility Verification   If you are receiving compensation or a stipend from  CMU, if you are going to be a TA or you are  planning to seek a position with CMU, then Em ployment Eligibility Verification is required.   Form I-9 must be completed within 3 busine ss days of beginning work for any type of  compensation (stipend or employment). Addi tional details are highlighted below. 20   To ensure compliance with federal law, Carnegie Mellon University maintains the Employment  Eligibility Verification (I-9) Policy [pdf]  covering the university’s I- 9 and E-Verify requirements:   Every individual receiving a stipend from CMU or  employed by CMU must comply with the I-9  Policy by completing the Form I-9 within thre e business days following the first day of stipend  start date/employment.   Individuals who expect to work  on a federally funded projec t are further responsible for  submitting an E-Verify Processing Request Form to the Office of Human Resources.   For more information, please see CMU’s Guidance for Completing the Form I-9 and E-Verify  Requirements at CMU [pdf] , or visit the Human Reso urces Service website to learn more about  Form I-9 and E-Verify  and to schedule an appointment to  complete the Form I-9.   10.6 MSAII Orientation   Each Fall semester, the MSAII pr ogram provides a program orientation to help new students  learn about the program. All new students are re quired to attend them and treat them seriously  because they explain the program sequence, it s Core and Knowledge co urses requirements and  how students will meet the program learning outcomes.   10.7 End of Semester Evaluation  The MSAII program conducts an academic progress re view at the conclusion of each semester in  order to monitor individual student progress towa rds graduation. Should a student’s effort fall  below the acceptable level of academic perfor mance and/or fail to meet the standards  established by the MSAII program, the stud ent may be dismissed from the program.  After each academic progress revi ew, a student may receive one or  more letters, indicating the  result of the review. See Section 3.1, Co urse Grade and GPA Requirements, above.  At the end of the semester, the faculty evaluate s each student's academic progress. If a student  seems to be having trouble, th e faculty determines whether it believes that the student can  finish the degree, and if  so, what needs to be accomplished to get back on track. This type of  letter should be considered a serious warning. It is not a permanent "black mark" on the  student's record; if the student begins making sa tisfactory progress again, there is no official  record of the letter in the student's transcript.  In the most serious cases, the faculty gives the stud ent a letter that specifies a list of conditions  that the student must satisfy by specific deadlines . Failure to meet all of the specified conditions  may result in the student's te rmination from the program. 21   10.8 Enrollment Verification  Enrollment Services is the only University office th at can provide an official letter of enrollment,  official transcript, and enrollment verification.  Enrollment verification can be requested online  through The HUB at www.cmu.edu/hub/registrar/student-records/transcripts/ .   10.9 University Policies on Grades and Grading  10.9.1  University Policy on Grades  www.cmu.edu/policies/student-an d-student-life/grading.html     This policy offers details concerning university grading principles for students taking courses  and covers the specifics of assigning and changi ng grades, grading options, drop/withdrawals,  and course repeats.  It also defines the un dergraduate and graduate grading standards.  10.9.2  University Policy on Grades for Transfer Courses & PCHE  www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student -life/transfer-credit-evaluation-and- assignment.html    Carnegie Mellon University offers students the o pportunity to take courses for credit through a  cross-registration program (see Pittsburgh Co uncil on Higher Education (PCHE) and Cross- registration below) and through the receipt of tr ansfer credit from other accredited institutions.  The Carnegie Mellon University transcript will in clude information on such courses as follows:  Carnegie Mellon courses and courses taken throug h the university's cross-registration program  will have grades recorded on the transcript and be factored into the QPA. All other courses will  be recorded on this transcript indicating where the course was taken but without a grade. Such  courses will not be taken into account for academic actions, honors  or QPA calculations. (Note:  Suspended students may take courses elsewhere; ho wever, they may receive transfer credit only  if their college’s and department's policies allow this.)   The MSAII program does not accept transfer credit for courses taken prior to matriculation at  Carnegie Mellon.  The MSAII program does not accept  distance education credits except for distance courses  offered by Carnegie Mello n or PCHE institutions.  10.10 Academic Integrity  Carnegie Mellon’s Academic Integrity policy is posted at   https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and -student-life/academic-integrity.html.  All students 22   are expected to be familiar with this policy, including the university-wi de protocol for handling  academic integrity violations.  The policy incl udes the University expectations around academic  integrity and provides definitions of cheati ng, plagiarism, and unauthorized assistance.   A review of the University’s Academ ic Disciplinary Actions procedures  (https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/th eword/academic-discipline/index.html ) is also  recommended. These procedures outline the proc ess for investigating, reporting, and  adjudicating violations of the University Policy  on Academic Integrit y. The procedures also  outline the appeal process.  It is an absolute requirement  that the work you submit must be your own, unless you  specifically identify the source of any material th at is not yours.  This includes quotations and  material from websites.  In any written work (including presentations) you MUST list any  person other than yourself who assisted you in preparing that wo rk.  Any student who violates  the academic integrity policy will be subject to a University review that may result in  suspension or expulsion under University policies.  THE PROGRAM DIRECTOR, THE  FACULTY AND THE UNIVERSITY ARE VERY SERIOUS ABOUT ENFORCEMENT OF THE  ACADEMIC INTEGRITY POLICY.    You are not permitted to copy material from web pages, including Wikipedia, and present them  as your own work.  Any copied material MUST appe ar in quotation marks or italics and MUST  be accompanied by a citation to the original source.   Failure to do this violates CMU’s Policy on  Academic Integrity, which states, “In all academic work to be graded, the citation of all sources  is required. … Plagiarism is defined as the use of work or concepts contributed by other  individuals without proper attribution or citation . Unique ideas or materia ls taken from another  source for either written or oral use must be  fully acknowledged in academic work to be  graded.”  It is a violation of academic integrity for you to assist anyone else in violating the policy or to  provide your work to others to assist them.  Be cause team deliverables are the product of joint  work, it is the responsibility of each member of  a team to ensure that all team materials have  been produced in conformance with CMU policies. Credit cannot be given fo r work that is not a  student’s own. Therefore, if one member of a team violates a policy, for example, by copying  material from the Internet without indicating it s source, then no one on the team can receive  credit for that work, even if only one studen t is directly guilty of violating the policy.  We are aware that acts that constitute cheating  can be viewed very di fferently in different  countries and cultures.  However, Carnegie Me llon is a U.S. university and its policies reflect  U.S. culture.  Employers expect that students  who graduate from Carnegie Mellon have  obtained their degree legitimately and according to Carnegie Mellon policies.  If you have any  doubt whether proposed conduct would be consi dered cheating under Carnegie Mellon policies,  ASK A FACULTY MEMBER OR THE DIRECTOR FIRST.   23   All violations of the Academic Integrity policy MUST be reported to the University  administration by the faculty members involved.  Copies go to the Program Director, the Head of  the Language Technology Institute, the Associate Dean for Master’s Programs, and various  officials at Warner Hall.   The faculty do not ha ve the option to decli ne to make a report.  The  offending student will receive an email to inform them of an A cademic Integrity Violation (AIV).  The email will specify the offense and the penalt y, and will inform the student of available  appeal procedures. An AIV that is successfully appealed is erased.  Important note:   The university policy gives a depart ment the option of “conven[ing] a  disciplinary hearing according to the procedure s of the department/pro gram.”  The LTI has a  “two strikes” rule.  The LTI may terminate a st udent for a first violation, depending upon the  circumstances and severity of the violation.  The LTI always terminates  a student for a second  violation, with no exceptions.   11 Academic Policies  11.1 Course Registration     11.1.1 Status  All Students must be registered for at least 48 units during each semest er. Any questions about  registration should be directed  to the Enrollment Serv ices (the HUB). Note that International  students are required to be re gistered as full-time students, minimum 36 units .    11.1.2 Academic Calendar   The Academic Calendar can be found at https://www.cmu.edu/hub/calendar/ .   All dates about  registration, add/drop deadlines, university ho lidays and more can be  found there.     11.1.3 Online Registration   All new students will register for required courses in Apri l after accepting admission and  receiving an Andrew ID. After that, students wi ll register following th e schedule set by the  HUB. Note that students must meet with thei r advisor to obtain approval for their course  selection. Registration information is available at  www.cmu.edu/hub/registrar/registration/index.html .  Online registration is done with an  Andrew ID at https://www.cmu.edu/hub/sio/about.html .    Students must register for at le ast 48 units per semester.   24   11.1.4 Double-Dipping  An MSAII student who applies courses taken as part of another degree program (at Carnegie  Mellon or elsewhere) toward their program requ irements cannot use those same courses toward  any other M.S. degree offered by the School of Computer Science without prior approval.  11.1.5 Pass/No Pass Courses (Pass/Fail)  With the approval of the Program Director , a graduate student may choose to take one  ELECTIVE course pass/no pass. Core courses an d Knowledge courses may not be taken pass/no  pass.  By the deadline for changing a course to  pass/no pass, the student must fill out the  Pass/No Pass Approval Form and receive permissio n from their advisor. A pass/no pass election  is irrevocable as a matter of CMU policy. (A form can be found at https://www.cmu.edu/hub/forms.html )  11.1.6 Auditing a Course   With the approval of the Program Director, a gr aduate student may audit a course by obtaining  the permission of the instructor or teaching department and completi ng the Course Audit  Approval Form. Audited classes are not taken for credit and cannot be used to fulfill graduation  requirements. (Audit form can be found at https://www.cmu.edu/hub/forms.html )   11.1.7 Adding a Course   During the ADD period of each se mester (the first two weeks of the semester), students may add  a course by registering online. After the ADD dead line, they may add a course by completing the  Late Add Request form and obta ining the permission of both: 1) the instructor or teaching  department and 2) their advisor.  (Add form can be found at  https://www.cmu.edu/hub/forms.html )    11.1.8 Dropping a Course   Dropping courses is not recommended except for reas ons of health or fami ly emergency.  Many  SCS courses have long waitlist s, and dropping a course means that some other student who  might have had the opportunity to take the course had been denied that ability.  Also, if students  in the MSAII program drop courses, then the inst ructors of those courses may no longer allow  MSAIIs to enroll.  Sometimes, however, a student’s workload can  become unexpectedly heavy because of course  requirements.  No one is expected to suffer from such pressure a nd dropping a course may  become a necessity.  To avoid this unfortunate circumstance, yo u should inform yourself in  advance of the curriculum and workload in each co urse you plan to take and ensure that you are  capable of handling the load.  Note that CMU SCS courses are very di fficult, and students who 25   may easily have handled taking five courses sim ultaneously at another institution may not be  able to do so at CMU.  Exact add, drop and withdrawal dates may be fou nd on the official Academic Calendar. Up until  the deadlines, students can initiate course adds and drops through Student Information Online  (SIO). Courses dropped by the deadline will not appear on the student's record, and courses  withdrawn from by the deadline will receive a 'W ' grade. Additionally, a voucher process has  been implemented for late drops.  Students taking undergraduate and Master’s level courses must follow the procedures and  deadlines for adding, dropping, or withdrawing from courses as identified on the academic  calendar. Information can be found at https://www.cmu.edu/hub/registrar/course- changes/index.html .  Late Course Drops & Vouchers  A late drop voucher system was implemented begi nning with the fall 2018 semester to permit a  limited number of late course drops. Master's st udents are permitted one drop voucher per year  of study and may use only one voucher per se mester (including summer).  Courses dropped  using a voucher will be removed from the student' s record, as long as the drop is confirmed in  SIO by the student within 24 hours of rece iving the automated voucher email (refer to  instructions below). Students may use drop vouche rs up until the last day of classes each  semester.  These policies are spelled out at https://www.cmu.edu/hub/registrar/course- changes/index.html .  Note that the Core courses and some Knowledg e courses are only offe red once per year so  dropping a course may delay program completion.   Note:  International students must maintain a minimu m of 36 units (Full time) to meet the U.S.  government’s visa requirement. Please check with  the Office of International Education (OIE)  for more information.    11.1.9 Transfer Credits   https://www.cmu.edu/policies/st udent-and-student-life/trans fer-credit-evaluation-and-  assignment.html  Carnegie Mellon University offers students the o pportunity to take courses for credit through a  cross-registration program (see Pittsburgh Co uncil on Higher Education (PCHE) and Cross- registration below) and through the receipt of tr ansfer credit from other accredited institutions.  The Carnegie Mellon University transcript will in clude information on such courses as follows:  Carnegie Mellon courses and courses taken throug h the university's cross-registration program  will have grades recorded on the transcript and be factored into the QPA. All other courses will  be recorded on this transcript indicating where the course was taken, but without grades. Such 26   courses will not be taken into account for academic actions, honors  or QPA calculations. (Note:  suspended students may take courses elsewhere; ho wever, they may receive transfer credit only  if their college's and department's policies allow this.).  The MSAII program does not accept transfer credits.  11.1.10  Leave of Absence   Students who need to delay their studies for pers onal, medical or academic reasons may do so  with a leave of absence (leaving the universit y temporarily with a co mmitment to return).  Students must contact the MSAII Director to discuss their plans and fill out the appropriate form.  The student’s place in the program will be  held until a mutually  determined time. For  more information refer to www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/student-leave.html .  When planning to return from Leave of Abs ence students must complete the appropriate  paperwork before returnin g to the University.    MSAII students who require longer than the standard time to complete their degree  requirements are expected to remain in close contact  with the program, and will be certified at  the end of the semester in which they have co mpleted their degree requirements. Students must  refer to the CMU Policy on Master ’s Student Statute of Limitations  (https://www.cmu.edu/policies/ student-and-student-life/masters-students-statute-of- limitations.html ) regarding guidelines and restrictions  which place an upper limit on the  maximum length of time allowable for maste r’s degree completion and certification.  11.1.11  Additional Guidance for Students    Program of study . Students seeking guidance about their program of study and degree  requirements should consult with their academic  advisor and/or appropriate associate dean.   Financial aid and student account.  Students are expected to make normal progress toward  their degree in order to graduate within the st andard timeframe for their program of study.  Under U.S. Federal Title IV regulations, student eligibility for federal financial aid is contingent  upon enrollment in and successful completion of courses that are counted as credit toward their  current degree program. To receive the maximum amount of federal financial aid for which they  may be eligible, students must enroll each semester  in at least 36 units that count toward their  current degree level. (See separate guidance  regarding integrated degree completion.)   Students should consult with their designated co llege liaison in The HU B regarding billing and  financial aid, particularly for early completion , longer-than-standard completion, or integrated  undergraduate and master’s degree programs.   International students . Immigration status for students in  F-1 and J-1 non-immigrant status is  tied to making normal progress toward completing  degree requirements. Therefore, F-1 and J-1 27   students who are considering completing their de gree requirements early, anticipating longer- than-standard completion, or moving from an un dergraduate to a graduate student classification  (integrated undergraduate-graduate study) should  consult with their designated advisor in the  Office of International Education (OIE) to ens ure compliance with immigration regulations.  11.1.12  Withdrawal    Students who need to withdraw from the program (leave the university with no intention of  returning) for personal, medical or academic reasons must contact the MSAII Director to  discuss their plans and fill out the appropri ate form. For more information refer to  www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and- student-life/student-leave.html .     11.2 Tuition and Fees    Information about tuition and fees is available at https://www.cmu.edu/sfs/tuition/index.html .   MSAII students will pay tuition according to the ra tes set for the School of Computer Science.   All tuition and fees must be paid in full by the due date; a student not in good financial standing  will be dismissed from the program. Students ta king summer courses must pay tuition.    11.3 Graduation Ceremonies    The University holds one Commencement ceremony in May of each year.  Only students who  have completed their degree requirem ents may participate in Commencement.  There are no August or December commencement ceremonies.   11.3.1 Withdrawal of Degree  A degree once conferred can be withdrawn by the University under certain circumstances.  See  the Withdrawal of Degree Policy .  11.4 LTI Academic Policies  11.4.1 “Grandfather” policy  A student can graduate under the policies in effect at the time that the student entered the  program; or, at the student's choice, the student  can graduate under policies that are adopted  after the student entered the program. If it is no t realistic to follow a particular policy exactly,  the department may approximate the policy as closely as possible; this situation is rare and  typically arises only when a student is enrolled in the program for an extended period. 28   11.4.2  Definition of transfer credit  versus course exemption   The LTI may grant transfer credit  or issue an exemption  for equivalent graduate courses  previously completed at another institution. This decision rests with the program director, on  the advice of the faculty memb er for whose course an exempt ion is sought. If a student is  exempt  from a required course due to  prior courses or experience, the student can replace that  course with an open elective. The student does  not receive credit for the exempted course but  can take any course that could normally count toward the degree in its place. If a student  receives credit  for prior coursework completed at Car negie Mellon or elsewhere, the student  receives that many units of credit and the to tal amount of required coursework is reduced by  that amount.  11.4.3  Employment/Consulting  Since consulting provides useful experience, stu dents are generally permitted to consult at most  one day per seven-day week, with the Program Di rector's consent.  International students must  also have approval in advance from the Office  of International Educat ion (OIE) for any paid  position.  Students may use their consulting time to perform unpa id work on research projects  for CMU faculty for up to 10 hours per week.  Students may serve as teaching assistants for CMU faculty.   TA work is inconsistent with  research because of the necessary time commitm ent.  Students must choose one activity or the  other, not both.  Note that there is an English language proficienc y requirement for TAs.  Graduate students are  required to have a certain level of  fluency in English before they can instruct in Pennsylvania, as  required by the English Fluency in Higher Ed ucation Act of 1990. Through this Act, all  institutions of higher educatio n in the state are required to ev aluate and certify the English  fluency of all instructional personnel, includ ing teaching assistants and interns. The full  university policy can be reviewed at: https://www.cmu.edu/polic ies/faculty/evaluation- certification-english-fluency-instructors.html .  11.4.4  Leave of Absence  The LTI discourages Leaves of Absence (LOA) since students usually do not return, despite  having good intentions. However,  a student in good standing may  be granted a LOA of at most  one year, upon written request to the MSAII Dire ctor and with the consent of the student's  advisor. It is the responsibility of  the student on LOA to contact th e LTI to initiate a return to  the program.  Students taking or returning from a leave of absence must follow the university’s leave of  absence process, which is described at www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student- life/student-leave.html.  29   11.4.5  Satisfactory Progress  If a student  does not make satisfactory progress each se mester toward completing the degree, the  LTI may remove the student from the program.  See section on “End of Semester Evaluation.”  11.5 Carnegie Mellon Academic Policies  11.5.1 Assistance for Individuals with Disabilities  The Office of Disability Resources at Carneg ie Mellon University has a continued mission to  provide physical and programmatic campus access to all events and information within the  Carnegie Mellon community.  We work to ensure that qualified individuals receive reasonable  accommodations as guaranteed by the Americans wi th Disabilities Act (ADA) and Sections 503  and 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.  St udents who would like to receive accommodations  must submit a Voluntary Disclosure of Disability Form  to access@andrew.cmu.edu  to begin the  interactive accommodation process.    For more information, please see https://www.cmu.edu/disability-resources/ .Students with  physical, sensory, cognitive, or  emotional disabilities are enco uraged to self-identify with the  Office of Disability Resources  and request needed accommodation s.  Any questions about the  process can be directed to access@andr ew.cmu.edu, or call (412) 268-6121.  11.5.2  Summary of Graduate Student A ppeal and Grievance Procedures  Students who believe that they ha ve been inappropriately treated are encouraged to raise their  concern(s) with the Program Director, department  head, or other designa ted person in their  department, college, or central administration accord ing to University policies.  No effort will be  made to prevent or discourage anyone from availing themselves of such procedures (see Graduate Student Appeal and Procedures www.cmu.edu/graduate/poli cies/appeal-grievance- procedures.html ).  Graduate students will find the Summary of  Graduate Student Appeal and Grievance  Procedures on the Graduate Education Reso urce web page.   This document summarizes  processes available to graduate students who se ek review of academic and non-academic issues.  Graduate students are expected to seek informal resolution of all concerns within the applicable  department, unit or program before invoking fo rmal processes. When an informal resolution  cannot be reached, however, a gr aduate student who seeks furthe r review of the matter is to  follow the formal procedures outlined here.   Th ese appeal and grievanc e procedures shall apply  to students in all graduate programs of the Univ ersity. Students should refer to the department  specific information in this handbook for dep artment and college information about the  administration and academic policies of the prog ram.  Additionally, students may confer with 30   the Graduate Education Office ( grad-ed@cmu.edu ) on issues of process or other concerns as  they navigate conflicts.  11.5.3  Process for Appealing Final Grades  https://www.cmu.edu/graduate/policies /appeal-grievance-procedures.html .   Final grades will be changed only in exceptiona l circumstances and only with the approval of  the instructor and the department, unit or prog ram. Grading is a matter of  sound discretion of  the instructor and final grades are rarely ch anged without the consent of the instructor who  assigned the grade.  The following circumstances are the unusual exceptions that may warrant a  grade appeal: (a) the final grade assigned for a cours e is based on manifest error (e.g. a clear error  such as arithmetic error in computing a grade or failure to grade one of the answers on an exam),  or (b) the faculty or staff member who assigned the grade did so in violation of a University  policy  11.5.4  Safeguarding Educational Equity:  Policy Against Sexual Harassment and Sexual Assault  The University prohibits sex-based discriminati on, sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating/  domestic violence and stalking. The University al so prohibits retaliation against individuals  who bring forward such concerns or allegation s in good faith.  The University’s Sexual  Misconduct Policy is available at www.cmu.edu/policies/administrative-and- governance/sexual-harassment-and-sexual-assault.html .   If you believe you have been the victim  of sexual harassment or sexual assault, you ar e encouraged to make contact with any of the  following resources:   Office of Title IX Initiatives, http://www.cmu.edu/title-ix/ , 412-268-7125   Sexual Harassment Advisors, found in A ppendix A of the Policy Against Sexual  Harassment and Sexual Assault;   Survivor Support Network, found in A ppendix B of the Policy Against Sexual  Harassment and Sexual Assault;   Sexual Harassment Process and Title IX Coordina tors, found in section II of the Policy  Against Sexual Harassment and Sexual Assault;   University Police, 412-268-2323   University Health Services, 412-268-2157   Counseling & Psychological Services, 412-268-2922 31   Additional resources and information can be found at :  https://www.cmu.edu/title-ix/resources- and-information/resources.html .  The University’s Policy Against Retaliation is available at  https://www.cmu.edu/policies/administrati ve-and-governance/whistleblower.html   The MSAII program has a ZERO TOLERANCE  policy on sexual harassment and sexual assault.  If you are found to have violated Carnegie Mell on policy, you will be dropped from the MSAII  program immediately without exception .  CMU has spent decades successfully developing a  non-threatening environment for all genders and no one will be permitted to  interfere with that  accomplishment.  Consensual Intimate Relationship Poli cy Regarding Undergraduate Students  https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-s tudent-life/consensual-relationships.html   This policy is relevant for graduate students who will be in a supervisory role of undergraduate  students as a TA or in a research lab/studio se tting.  This policy addresses the circumstances in  which romantic, sexual or amorous relationships/ interactions with undergraduate students,  even if consensual, are inappropriate and prohib ited. The purpose of this policy is to assure  healthy professional relationships. This policy is not intended to discoura ge consensual intimate  relationships unless there is a conflicting profe ssional relationship in  which one party has  authority over the other as in the policy.  11.5.5  Cultural Tolerance  The MSAII program is extremely diverse for a pr ogram of its size. We have students from  numerous different countries who must work effectively in a team se tting.  The students  invariably come from very different cultures that  have differing attitudes  towards age, gender,  and group interaction.  The program management understands this, but th e students must also  recognize that this program is being conducted in  the United States and operates according to  U.S. norms.  Students and faculty,  regardless of background, age, or rank, must deal with each  other respectfully without insult or raised voices .  It is impossible to conduct teamwork in any  other way.  Violations will be dealt with harshly.  The Program Director is not sympathetic to  such behavior, which will not be tolerated.  Re peated infractions, or a serious single infraction  may result in termination from the program.  11.5.6  Language Policy  The MSAII program is a component of the Language  Technologies Institute, which studies and  celebrates the diversity of human language and fo rms of expression.  The LTI also recognizes the  futility and unfairness of attempting to det ermine the language students must use when  communicating.  However, it is unprofessional in any official team meeting to speak a language 32   that is not understood by all team members.  Fo r example, if all members of a team understand  Chinese, then they may use Chi nese in team meetings.  However,  if even one team member does  not understand Chinese, then a language must be us ed that is understood by all team members.   It is recommended that non-native speakers of Eng lish use English as much as possible if they  intend to seek employment in  an English-speaking country.  11.5.7  Childbirth/Maternity Accommodation Protocol  The Maternity Policy is available at https://www.cmu.edu/graduate/programs- services/maternity-accommodation-protocol.html .  Students whose anticipated delivery date is duri ng the course of the semester may consider  taking time away from their coursework and re search responsibilities. All female students who  give birth to a child while engaged in coursework or  research are eligible to take either a short- term absence or formal leave of absence. St udents in course work should consider either  working with their course instructor to receive in complete grades or elect to drop to part-time  status or to take a semester leave of absence.   Students engaged in research must work with  their faculty to develop plans for the re search for the time  they are away.   ● Students must contact the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs to register for Maternity  Accommodations. Students will complete an info rmation form and meet with a member of the  Dean’s Office staff to determine resources and procedures appropriate for the individual student.  ○ Planning for the student’s discussio n with appropriate academic contact(s)  (advisor, associate dean, etc.) may be reviewed during this meeting.  ● Students in course work should consider op tions for the semester of the anticipated  birth such as working with their course instructo rs to receive incomplete grades, electing to  drop to part-time status or taking  a full semester leave of absence.  ● Students engaged in research  must work with their facu lty to develop plans for the  research for the time they are aw ay and for resuming upon return.  ● Master's students who receive an academ ic stipend funded by Carnegie Mellon are  eligible to continue to receive stipend funding for up to six (6) week s during a Short-Term  Maternity Accommodation or a Formal Leave of Absence. Continued academic stipend funding may be extended by two (2) weeks, for a total of eight (8) weeks, if an absence longer than six  weeks is medically necessary. To receive this supp ort students must be registered with the  Office of the Dean of Students.  Students are encouraged to consult with relevant university facu lty and staff as soon as possible  as they begin making plans regarding time away.   Students must contact the Office of the Dean  of Student Affairs to register for Maternity Accommodations.  Students will complete an  information form and meet with a member of De an’s Office staff to determine resources and 33   procedures appropriate for the i ndividual student. Planning fo r the student’s discussion with  her academic contact(s) (advisor, associate dean, etc.) will be reviewed during this meeting.  11.6 Statute of Limitations  As outlined in the Master’s Students Statute of Limitations, www.cmu.edu/policies/student- and-student-life/masters-students-statute-of-limitations.html , students must complete all  requirements for the master’s degree within  a maximum of seven years from original  matriculation as a master’s student, or less if re quired by a more restrictive department, school  or college policy.  Once this time-to-degree li mit has lapsed, the person may resume work  towards a master’s degree only if newly admitted  to a currently offered master’s degree program  under criteria determined by that program.  Under extraordinary circumstances, such as leave of absence, military or public service, family or  parental leave, or temporary disability, a school or college may, upon the relevant department's  recommendation and with the written approval of the dean (or designate), defer the lapse for a  period commensurate with the duration of that  interruption. Students who are pursuing a  master’s degree as part-time students for all seme sters of their program,  as approved by their  program, may also appeal to their program or department for extension of the time to degree  limit.   Any request for a waiver of the statute of limita tions must be approved by  the Department Head  and by the SCS Associate Dean for Masters Programs. The waiver request must explain the  exceptional circumstances that wa rrant an extension. For cases in which a waiver is granted,  the waiver will cover specific courses and will specify a time period for completion of the  program.  See also the ‘Duration of Study’ policy.  11.7 Residency Requirement  The MSAII is a full-time, in-resid ence program conducted only on the Pittsburgh campus.  In  exceptional circumstances, such as visa compli cations or medical exigencies, permission may be  granted by the Director allowing a student to participate in short portions of the program  remotely.  This is not possible for first-year students.  12 Financial Issues  12.1 Graduate Student Funding  34   The LTI does not provide financial aid or support to students in the professional MS programs.   Students are encouraged to seek financial aid and s upport from other sources.  The HUB website  (https://www.cmu.edu/sfs/financial-aid/graduate/index.html ) provides the Graduate Financial  Aid Guide, information about funding options and how to apply for fi nancial aid and other  helpful links.  Additional information on financial issues  for graduate students can be found on  the web at www.cmu.edu/hub/new-grad/ .  Students in the professional MS  programs are not prohibited from seeking support as Teaching  Assistants and Research Assistants.  However, typi cally full-time MS students do not have time  for these activities.  Typically Research Assistants hips are most likely to be awarded to students  in Carnegie Mellon’s research-oriented degree programs.  12.2 University Financial Aid  Graduate students should consu lt the graduate student financia l aid information found on The  HUB website: www.cmu.edu/sfs/financial-aid/graduate/index.html .  Students will find the  Graduate Financial Aid Guide, in formation about funding options and how to apply for financial  aid and other helpful links.  12.3 Health Insurance   Carnegie Mellon has a Student Health Insurance policy requiring full-time, degree-seeking  students to carry adequate medical  insurance. Students must either  purchase the plan offered by  the University or an application for a waiver can be made if the stud ent is “enrolled as the  dependent, partner/spouse or principal in an employer or government-sponsored insurance  plan” (see the Carnegie Mellon University Student Health Insurance Policy at  https://www.cmu.edu/policies/ student-and-student-life/stu dent-health-insurance.html ).   It is the responsibility of each student to make arrangements with Student  Health Services to  either pay for their insurance at the beginning of  the semester, or elect a payment plan over the  course of the academic year. More information is available at the Student Health Services Web  site www.cmu.edu/health-services/student-insurance/ .   12.4 Emergency Loans   https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/dean/loans/   All students regardless of their program are eligib le for the Emergency Student Loan, which is an  interest-free and emergency-based loan repayabl e within 30 days. It is available through the  Office of the Dean of Student Affairs; students  may apply for the loan by stopping in to the  Student Affairs Office, Warner Hall 321, or by  calling (412) 268-2075 for an appointment.  35   13 Additional University Resources  13.1 The HUB Student Services Center   thehub@andrew.cmu.edu  and www.cmu.edu/hub/    The HUB is located in Warner Hall , Lower Level.

136	About Scotty  The Scottish terrier has long been a familiar figure around Carnegie Mellon's campus. For years students have suited up in an unofficial Scottish terrier costume to excite the fans at athletic events. But the relationship between the Scottish terrier breed and Carnegie Mellon far precedes anybody doing somersaults in a dog costume. Andrew Carnegie, founder of the university, kept a Scottish terrier as his pet.  Scotty's road from popular icon to official mascot of the university began in 2006. Carnegie Mellon formed a Mascot Identity Task Force in November 2006, which consisted of students, faculty, staff and alumni. The Task Force was co-chaired by Director of Athletics Susan Bassett and Dean of Student Affairs Jennifer Church.  The mascot selection process included a series of surveys and a university Town Hall meeting. Nearly 78 percent of 2,370 students surveyed in February 2007 voted for the Scottish terrier, and approximately 25 percent of 400 alumni surveyed thought the Scottish terrier was already the mascot.  In the spring, the Task Force partnered with SME Branding — a firm with more than 17 years of experience creating mascots for professional sports teams and universities — to develop the graphics for the mascot. During October, students and alumni reviewed potential mascot images in focus groups.  Carnegie Mellon's official mascot debuted at the Nov. 10, 2007 home football game. The graphic features a profile of a distinguished, bold Scottish terrier sporting a plaid scarf around his neck. The dog is contained in a shield, representing Carnegie Mellon's Scottish heritage.  The Task Force then partnered with a mascot costume company to design our Scottish terrier in the winter of 2007. The official Scotty costume was unveiled at the 2008 Spring Carnival.

Welcome  Welcome to the Language Technologies Institute, Master of  Computational Data Science Program. While this handbook is specific to  your academic experience in the department, there are several other  resources and offices graduate students are encouraged to consult during  their tenure at Carnegie Mellon University. Information about The Word,  the student handbook, the Office of Graduate and Postdoctoral Affairs, the  Office of the Dean of Students, and others are included in Appendix A of  this handbook.  1.1 The MCDS Degree  The MCDS Degree The Master of Computational Data Science (MCDS)  degree is a professional Master of Science degree offered by the Language  Technologies Institute (LTI), a department in the School of Computer  Science at Carnegie Mellon University. The MCDS degree offers students  with a Bachelor's degree the opportunity to improve their training with  advanced study in Computer Science and Machine Learning. We cater to  students with basic analytic skills and a strong aptitude for mathematics,  programming, and logical reasoning. An undergraduate degree in  Computer Science is not required. Most students will complete the  program in three semesters; students coming from other disciplines and  students focus on developing applied research skills in preparation for  further graduate study or research-oriented employment may require an  additional fourth semester.    The MCDS Program offers a core curriculum and several concentrations;  students entering the program enroll in core courses in their first  semester and select further courses to satisfy at least one concentration  (see Section 3.3.6). Students construct their own course of study, in  consultation with their academic advisor, in order to satisfy broad  guidelines. Thus, a student may tailor their coursework in a given  concentration to follow a particular area of emphasis. The MCDS program  is typically a 16-month program consisting of courses, seminars, a  required Capstone Project and a required summer internship or practical  training. While some MCDS graduates continue on to PhD programs in the  LTI or other leading universities, most graduates go on to jobs in    7corporate research and development laboratories.    The program consists entirely of coursework and a Capstone Project, and  no Master’s Thesis is required. All Capstone projects are structured as  research activities and may lead to a publication. There is no Doctoral  program in Computational Data Science. Because of the highly selective  nature of the MCDS program and quality of the MCDS curriculum,  performing well in the program will give a boost to a PhD application. MS  graduates are welcome to apply to CMU PhD programs but will not receive  preferential treatment.    There are significant differences between CMU's different departments  and degree programs in philosophical approach, procedures, policies and  regulations. Each department issues a handbook that informs graduate  students of their program requirements and procedures and ensures that  students have written access to the standard information outlined below.  This handbook describes the policies, procedures, and requirements for  the Master of Computational Data Science (MCDS) degree.  All policies not explicitly described in this document conform to School of  Computer Science (SCS) policies and university policies described in The  Word, Carnegie Mellon University Student Handbook and at the  University Policies website.  1.2 Vision  Carnegie Mellon University will have a transformative impact on society  through continual innovation in education, research, creativity, and  entrepreneurship.  1.3 Mission  To create a transformative educational experience  for students focused on  deep disciplinary knowledge; problem solving; leadership,  communication, and interpersonal skills; and personal health and well- being.  To cultivate a transformative university community  committed to (a)  attracting and retaining diverse, world-class talent; (b) creating a  collaborative environment open to the free exchange of ideas, where    8research, creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship can flourish; and  (c) ensuring individuals can achieve their full potential.  To impact society in a transformative way  — regionally, nationally, and  globally — by engaging with partners outside the traditional borders of the  university campus.  1.4 MCDS Contact Information  The people responsible for administering the MCDS degree are:    Jennifer M Lucas   Academic Program Manager  Master of Computational Data Science   Language Technologies Institute  School of Computer Science   Carnegie Mellon University  Gates-Hillman Center 6415  5000 Forbes Avenue, Pgh, PA 15213  Phone: (412) 268-9870  Fax: (412) 268-7287    Carolyn Penstein Rosé, Director   Master of Computational Data Science   Language Technologies Institute  School of Computer Science  Carnegie Mellon University  Gates-Hillman Center 5419  5000 Forbes Avenue, Pgh, PA 15213  Phone: (412) 268-4525  Fax: (412) 268-7287  Robert Frederking   Graduate Program Chair  Language Technologies Institute  School of Computer Science   Carnegie Mellon University  Gates-Hillman Center 6515  5000 Forbes Avenue, Pgh, PA 15213  Phone: (412) 268 -6656 Mona Diab, LTI Director   Language Technologies Institute  School of Computer Science   Carnegie Mellon University  Gates-Hillman Center 5723  5000 Forbes Avenue, Pgh, PA 15213  Phone: (412) 268-3669    The Language Technologies Institute is located primarily on the 5th and 6th floors of the  Gates Hillman Complex (GHC) on Carnegie Mellon’s Pittsburgh campus:    Language Technologies Institute  Carnegie Mellon University  5000 Forbes Avenue  Gates Hillman Complex 5402, LTI  Pittsburgh, PA 15241-3891    412-268-6591 (phone)  412-268-6298 (fax)  http://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/     91.5 University Policies and Expectations  Each member of the Carnegie Mellon community must be familiar with university  policies and guidelines. In addition to this departmental graduate student handbook,  the following resources are available to assist you in understanding community  expectations:     The Word/Student  Handbook:  http://www.cmu.edu/student - affairs/theword/index .html    Academic Integrity  Website: https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student -and-student-  life/academic-integrity.html     University Policies  Website:  http://www.cmu.ed u/policies/     Office of Graduate and  Post-Doc Affairs: http://www.cmu.edu/graduate/policies/index.html   Please see Appendix A for additional information about university resources.  1.6 Carnegie Mellon University Statement of Assurance   Carnegie Mellon University does not discriminate in admission, employment or  administration of its programs or activities on the basis of race, color, national origin,  sex, handicap or disability, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, creed,  ancestry, belief, veteran status or genetic information. Furthermore, Carnegie Mellon  University does not discriminate and is required not to discriminate in violation of  federal, state or local laws or executive orders.    Inquiries concerning the application of and compliance with this statement should be  directed to the university ombudsman, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Avenue,  Pittsburgh, PA 15213, telephone 412-268-1018. Obtain general information about  Carnegie Mellon University by calling 412-268-2000.    Carnegie Mellon University publishes an annual campus security and fire safety report.  describing the university's security, alcohol and drug, sexual assault and fire safety  policies, and containing statistics about the number and type of crimes committed on the  campus, and the number and cause of fires in campus residence facilities during the  preceding three years. You can obtain a copy by contacting the Carnegie Mellon Police  Department at 412-268-2323. The annual security and fire safety report also is available  online at  www.cmu.edu/police/annualreports .     Information regarding the application of Title IX, including to admission and  employment decisions, the sexual misconduct grievance procedures and process,  including how to file a  report or a complaint of sex discrimination, how to file a report of sexual harassment,  and how the university responds to such reports is available at www.cmu.edu/title-ix . The  Title IX    10coordinator may be reached at 412-268-7125 or tix@cmu.edu .    1.7 The Carnegie Mellon Code     Students at Carnegie Mellon, because they are members of an academic community  dedicated to the achievement of excellence, are expected to meet the highest standards  of  personal, ethical and moral conduct possible.    These standards require personal integrity, a commitment to honesty without  compromise, as well as truth without equivocation and a willingness to place the good of  the community above the good of the self. Obligations once undertaken must be met,  commitments kept.    As members of the Carnegie Mellon community, individuals are expected to uphold the  standards of the community in addition to holding others accountable for said standards.  It is  rare that the life of a student in an academic community can be so private that it will not  affect the community as a whole or that the above standards do not apply.    The discovery, advancement and communication of knowledge are not possible without  a  commitment to these standards. Creativity cannot exist without acknowledgment of the  creativity of others. New knowledge cannot be developed without credit for prior  knowledge. Without the ability to trust that these principles will be observed, an  academic community cannot exist.    The commitment of its faculty, staff and students to these standards contributes to the  high  respect in which the Carnegie Mellon degree is held. Students must not destroy that  respect by their failure to meet these standards. Students who cannot meet them should  voluntarily  withdraw from the university.    The Carnegie Mellon Code can also be found on-line at:  https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/theword/ .  2 The Language Technologies Institute   2.1 Main Office  The Gates Hillman Complex: Mailboxes, printers, copiers, and other departmental  resources are in GHC 5404.    112.2 Photocopies and Printers  The use of a printer/copier requires a CS user id (see the ‘Computers’ section). The School  of Computer Science provides several black-and-white and color printers for use by  students. SCS Computing Facilities maintains a list of printers:   http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~help/printing/.   2.3 Office Space for MS Students  Full-time students in the LTI’s MS degree programs on the Pittsburgh campus have  access to a shared working space to create a sense of community and provide space for  working when on campus.  2.4 Computers for MS Students  Students are expected to provide their own laptop computers that can be used to access  university resources and complete course assignments. Laptops running Windows,  MacOS, and Linux software are all acceptable.    MS students will be given a CS user id. A CS user id is required to use the LTI computer  cluster, department printers, and other SCS services. The School of Computer Science  has a Help Center located at 4203 GHC. They can be contacted at help@cs.cmu.edu ,  extension 8-4231 from a campus phone, or 412-268-4231 from an outside line.    MS students will be given access to the LTI’s computer cluster on an as-needed basis, to  be used for course assignments, directed study projects, and/or the capstone project. The  LTI cluster provides storage and computation for projects involving large datasets and/or  lengthy computation.   3 MCDS Degree Completion and Certification   This section describes the various rules and regulations that determine the attainment of  a MCDS degree by the student.  3.1 CMU Degree Completion and Statute of Limitations  Carnegie Mellon graduate students are expected to complete their degree requirements  within the standard length of time for their program of study as outlined in the relevant  Graduate Student Handbook. Standard program lengths for graduate students vary  significantly – ranging from two semesters for some full-time master’s programs to  several or more years for doctoral programs. Upon completion of the graduate program  degree requirements, the degree will be certified by the student’s academic program in  the semester in which the student completes the requirements.  Early Completion  Graduate students who consider the completion of all degree requirements in less than  the standard length of time for their program of study may consult with their degree-   12granting program or department to determine if early degree certification is allowed and  under what circumstances.  Extended or Longer-than-Standard Completion  Longer-than-standard degree completion may occur due to academic interruptions in  making progress toward the degree as defined by the academic program, interruptions  of full-time study or progress towards the degree due to serious, documented medical  issues, or other unusual or unforeseen circumstances. Master’s students who require  longer than the standard time to complete their degree requirements are expected to  remain in close contact with their graduate program and will be certified at the end of the  semester in which they have completed their degree requirements.   Policy on Master’s Student Statute of Limitations  www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/masters-students-statute-of- limitations.html      See the above link regarding guidelines and restrictions which place an upper limit on  the maximum length of time allowable for master’s degree completion and certification.  Additional Guidance for Students  Program of study. Students seeking guidance about their program of study and degree  requirements should consult with their academic advisor and/or appropriate associate  dean.    Financial aid and student account  Students are expected to make normal progress toward their degree to graduate within  the standard timeframe for their program of study. Under U.S. Federal Title IV  regulations, student eligibility for federal financial aid is contingent upon enrollment in  and successful completion of courses that are counted as credit toward their current  degree program. To receive the maximum amount of federal financial aid for which they  may be eligible, students must enroll each semester in at least 36 units that count toward  their current degree level. (See separate guidance regarding integrated degree  completion.) Students should consult with their designated college liaison in The HUB  regarding billing and financial aid, particularly for early completion, longer-than- standard completion, or integrated undergraduate and master’s degree programs.    International students    Immigration status for students in F-1 and J-1 non-immigrant status is tied to making  normal progress toward completing degree requirements. Therefore, F-1 and J-1  students who are considering completing their degree requirements early, anticipating  longer-than-standard completion, or moving from an undergraduate to a graduate  student classification (integrated undergraduate-graduate study) should consult with  their designated advisor in the Office of International Education (OIE) to ensure  compliance with immigration regulations.    133.2 Full-time Status  All MCDS students are expected to enroll full-time (at present, there is no option to pursue  the degree as a part-time student). To be considered a full-time student, a student must  be registered for, and complete, a minimum of 36 units in every Fall and Spring semester.  All international students are required by US Federal law to maintain full-time status.  Students can have no more than one (1) remote course counting toward the 36 units used  to satisfy full-time enrollment. Failure to maintain full-time status will result in loss of a  student visa (and, therefore, “permit of stay”). All students having a Stafford Loan are  required to maintain full-time status.    3.3 MCDS Degree Enrollment Process and Related Information  3.3.1 Duration of the degree program  The MCDS degree must be completed within five (5) years from the time that the student  matriculates into the program.    https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/masters-students-statute-of- limitations.html     As outlined in the Master’s Students Statute of Limitations (see link above), students will  complete all requirements for the master’s degree within a maximum of seven years from  original matriculation as a master’s student, or less if required by a more restrictive  department, school or college policy. Once this time-to-degree limit has lapsed, the  person may resume work towards a master’s degree only if newly admitted to a currently  offered master’s degree program under criteria determined by that program.    Under extraordinary circumstances, such as leave of absence, military or public service,  family or parental leave, or temporary disability, a school or college may, upon the  relevant department's recommendation and with the written approval of the dean (or  designate), defer the lapse for a period commensurate with the duration of that  interruption. Students who are pursuing a master’s degree as part-time students for all  semesters of their program, as approved by their program, may also appeal to their  program or department for extension of the time to degree limit.    3.3.2 Residency requirements  There is no formal residence requirement. However, most courses in the program are  taught on campus without an option for distance education. Students enrolled in in- person course sections (IPR) are expected to attend all class meetings in person.  3.3.3 Degree Certification: Course requirements and related policies/protocols    14 In order to receive the MCDS degree, students must have a Quality Point Average  (QPA) of 3.0. Completion of the degree is based on completing courses in the core  curriculum, the MCDS seminar, electives and capstone project.   The capstone project consists of students working at CMU on a research project,  or on an industry-sponsored project.   The student must complete 144 eligible units of study. This includes eight core and  concentration courses, two 12-unit seminar courses and two 12-unit capstone  courses. All students complete a common MCDS core in their first two semesters,  consisting of five courses. All students must also complete at least one  concentration, consisting of three courses in one of three areas: Analytics,  Systems, or Human-Centered Data Science. The remaining elective course can be  any course with number 600 or above chosen from the SCS course catalog. Any  additional non-prerequisite units taken beyond the 144 units are also considered  electives.   To maintain full-time enrollment status, a student must enroll in a minimum of 36  course units per semester. A student may not take more than 60 units per  semester, without permission from their academic advisor. Students must  maintain full-time enrollment status (minimum of 36 units) in their final semester.  3.3.4 Prerequisite Core Course  All MCDS students are expected to pass the 11-637 Foundations of Computational Data  Science course by the end of their first semester. Each student must pass 11-637 with a  grade of “B” or better.   3.3.5 Plan of study  The degree consists of two timing options based on the length of time the student spends  working on the degree. The student chooses their timing at the start of the degree  program (for visa requirements). Changes in timing are possible with the approval of the  Director of the degree program and successful visa extension application with CMU’s  Office of International Education. Note that all degree options consist of the same amount  of coursework:       Professional Preparation Track – a 16-month degree consisting of study for Fall  and Spring semesters, a summer internship, and Fall semester of study. Each  semester consists of a minimum of 48 units of study. This timing is typical for most  students. The student graduates in December.   Research Preparation Track – a 20-month degree consisting of study for Fall and  Spring semesters, a summer internship, and a second year of Fall and Spring  study. Each semester consists of a minimum of 36 units of study. This timing is  designed for students interested in extending their time at CMU for developing  applied research skills in preparation for further graduate study or research- oriented employment. Note that the per-semester course load is lower, but the  total cost is higher since four semesters of tuition are paid. This timing is also    15recommended for students interested in pursuing a PhD after graduation. The  student graduates in May.  3.3.6.1 MCDS Curriculum  All MCDS students must complete 144 units of graduate study which satisfy the  following curriculum:   11-637 - Foundations of Computational Data Science   Four (4) additional MCDS Core Courses (10-601 Introduction to Machine  Learning; 05-839 Interactive Data Science; 15-619 Cloud Computing; 11-631 Data  Science Seminar; 48 units)   Three courses (3) from one area of concentration curriculum (36 units)   Three (3) MCDS Capstone courses (11-634, 11-635 and 11-632) (36 units)   One (1) Elective: any graduate level course 600 and above in the School of  Computer Science (12 units)    3.3.6.2 Common MCDS Core Courses  All MCDS students are required to complete four common core courses in their first two  semesters:   10-601 - Machine Learning   15-619 - Cloud Computing   05-839 - Interactive Data Science   11-631 - Data Science Seminar    3.3.6.3 Areas of Concentration  In addition to the common MCDS core, all students must complete at least one area of  concentration, which consists of three courses in Analytics, Systems, or Human- Centered Data Science. Students consult with their academic advisor and choose one or  more areas of concentration during their first semester, in preparation for enrolling in  Spring classes.       Analytics concentration:  o One (1) Machine Learning course  o One (1) Software Systems course  o One (1) big data course   Systems concentration:  o 15-513 Introduction to Computer Systems (elective, prerequisite for many  advanced Systems courses)  o Three (3) systems project courses   Human-Centered Data Science concentration:  o One (1) Methods course  o Two (2) HCI courses    16  A detailed list of courses satisfying each concentration is contained in the MCDS Program  FAQ.    3.3.6.4 MCDS Capstone Courses  All MCDS students complete three Capstone courses:   11-634 - Capstone Planning Seminar (12 units)   11-635 - Capstone Research (12 units)   11-632 - Data Science Capstone (12 units)    MCDS Program Learning Outcomes      Design, implement and evaluate the use of analytic algorithms on sample  datasets.    Explain how a machine-learning model is developed for and evaluated on real  world datasets.   Design and execute experimental data collection and present resulting analyses  using appropriate user experience (UX) techniques including interactive data  visualizations.   Apply and customize analytics, systems and human-centered data science  techniques to application-specific data science requirements and objectives.   Identify tradeoffs among data science techniques (analytics, systems and/or  human-centered) and contrast design alternatives, within the context of specific  data science application domains.   Survey, interpret and comparatively criticize state of the art research talks and  papers, with emphasis on constructive improvements.   Organize, execute, report on, and present a real world data science project in  collaboration with other researchers/programmers.    Depending on the concentration, additional learning outcomes are emphasized:    Analytics.  Students electing to complete the Analytics concentration will also learn to:      Design, implement and evaluate a software system and machine-learning model  on real world datasets at real world scale.    Analyze and document data science requirements in different application  domains and survey as well as critique state of the art solutions for those  requirements.    Systems.  Students electing to complete the Systems concentration will also learn to:       17 Implement and evaluate complex, scalable data science systems, with emphasis  on providing experimental evidence for design decisions.   Anticipate and avert structural and/or implementation problems with systems  design, especially with scaling and tail distributions.    HCDS. Students electing to complete the Human-Centered Data Science (HCDS)  concentration will also learn to:      Design, implement and evaluate a user experience prototype to allow for clear  understanding of data science solutions.   Apply social and behavioral research methods to data science problems to  understand the human aspects of data collection and analysis.     Throughout their coursework, students will take introductory courses on all those topics,  practice them in advanced courses and seminars and demonstrate all learned skills in  their Capstone project and internship. Students are encouraged to choose elective  courses in the curriculum according to their professional goals and mastery of the main  subjects.     3.3.10 Capstone project  The capstone project consists of students working in a team or individually on a project.  The capstone project integrates the educational experience of the student. A capstone  project is typically a CMU research project, or an industry sponsored project;  occasionally students define capstone topics through communication with the faculty.  Students interested in defining their own capstone topics should discuss with the MCDS  faculty as early as possible. The capstone project is a great opportunity for a student (or  student team) to “show off” their unique skills and accomplishments. Capstone projects  have been instrumental in the hiring decisions for several employers.      3.3.11 Elective courses  Electives can be any graduate level course (numbered 600 or above) in the School of  Computer Science. Students use their elective courses to enhance study in an area of  interest or to explore new areas of interest.  3.3.12 Undergraduate courses  Undergraduate courses are taken to address an area of weakness in the student’s prior  preparation. Undergraduate courses (numbered less than or equal to 599) may be taken  pass/fail or for credit but do not count toward the 144 units of eligible study: The course  and course grade will appear on the student’s transcript, and the course grade will factor  as part of the student’s QPA.    183.3.13 Independent study course  Independent study courses allow students to cover study of a particular area of interest,  and are used when no formal course is available in a given subject area. Students who are  interested in continuing to a Ph.D. degree often enroll in Independent Study, since it  offers the opportunity to perform research directly with a faculty member. Independent  study courses are considered electives.    Each independent study course must be advised and approved by at least one faculty  member. Agreement to supervise an independent study course is purely voluntary on the  part of the faculty member. It is the duty of the student, therefore, to negotiate the terms  and conditions of the independent study with the pertinent faculty members of CMU who  will be supervising the study. These individuals are referred to as “independent study  supervisors.” Once the student finds someone who agrees to supervise such a course,  he/she must:      1. Students wishing to take an independent study must request approval from their  academic advisor and complete proposal before the first day of classes in a given  semester:  2. Enter into an agreement with the independent study supervisor that includes  course expectations, including deliverables.  3. Secure the “Independent Study Contract Form” from the MCDS administrator.  4. Complete the form, provide a brief description of the work to be done, including  deliverables and how they will be graded.  5. Secure signatures of both the student and the supervisor. Return the form to the  MCDS administrator in order to obtain approval for the independent study from the  Director.    Independent study contracts must be submitted no later than on the last day of the first  week of classes in a given semester.  3.3.14 Double counting courses  No course may be used to complete two MCDS degree requirements, nor may a course  satisfy requirements in two degree programs.  3.3.15 Courses outside of the School of Computer Science  Elective courses in other Schools at Carnegie Mellon may be taken with prior permission  of the Director.  3.3.16 Grades  All courses offered by the SCS CMU are graded on the 4.3 grading standard   http://www.cmu.edu/policies/documents/Grades.html.  MCDS students must maintain a  3.0 overall average each semester to remain in good standing. A student must obtain a B-  or better grade in all courses, which count towards core requirements. If a student    19receives a C- or better, that course may count as an elective towards the degree  requirements. All courses must receive a letter grade; courses taken pass/fail do not  count towards the MCDS degree.    Enrollment Services is the only University office that can provide an official letter of  enrollment, official transcript and enrollment verification. Enrollment verification can  be requested online through The HUB at: https://www.cmu.edu/hub/registrar/student- records/verifications/   3.3.17 Student Review, Academic Probation and Academic Actions  The MCDS program conducts an academic progress review at the conclusion of each  semester in order to monitor individual student progress towards graduation regarding  the fulfillment of curricular requirements, course grades, and academic integrity. Should  a student’s effort fall below the acceptable level of academic performance and/or fail to  meet standards and policies established by Carnegie Mellon University, the student may  be dismissed from the program.    Infractions     After each academic progress review, each student will receive a letter indicating the  result of the review and their standing in the program. If applicable, the letter will also  note the following infractions by the student in the given semester:   Cumulative QPA is below 3.0, resulting in the student being put on Academic  Probation  (see below)   Cumulative QPA is below 2.6, resulting in academic probation or possible  dismissal (see below)   Academic Integrity Violation (AIV) deemed an infraction by the MCDS committee  (see 3.7.2)    Minimum QPA and Academic Probation     Students must maintain a cumulative QPA of 3.0 to remain in good standing with the  program. Should a student’s overall QPA drop below 3.0 during any given semester,  he/she will be placed on academic probation  for the following semester. In probation  cases, the student will be required to   enroll in courses as advised by the academic advisor,    improve his/her grades to no less than an overall 3.0 QPA in the following  semester, and    meet any other goal set by the advisor during that period (e.g., fulfilling a core  course requirement).   If a student’s cumulative QPA drops below 2.6, the student will be considered at risk of  being unable to complete the program and will be considered for dismissal. He/she will  be required to meet the program director to discuss his/her situation. Only if, after that  meeting, the MCDS program committee ascertains that the student is likely to complete    20the remaining program requirements in the allotted time, the student will be allowed to  continue his/her studies in MCDS, and dismissed otherwise. If the student is allowed to  continue their studies, they will be placed on academic probation for the following  semester and is subject to the requirements above.    Dismissal     A student may be dismissed from the program for any of the following cases:   If the student has been put on academic probation and failed to meet the remedial  requirements set by the advisor in the following semester, or committed an  Academic Integrity Violation deemed an infraction by the MCDS committee while  on academic probation   If the student has a cumulative QPA of 2.6 or lower and the MCDS program  committee does not ascertain that the student is likely to complete the remaining  program requirements in the allotted time   If the student has committed two Academic Integrity Violation deemed infractions  by the MCDS committee (see 3.7.2)   If the student has committed an Academic Integrity Violation infraction where the  violation is deemed to be sufficiently egregious as determined by the MCDS  program committee   If the student has been found to infringe a University Policy, where such  infringement is deemed grounds for dismissal    Students who realize that one of these situations may apply to them are strongly  encouraged to meet with the academic advisor to discuss a plan to mitigate the situation.  Students who find they are struggling in the program will have the best chances of success  if they communicate early and often with the academic advisor.    3.3.18 Incomplete grades  Carnegie Mellon University students are expected to complete a course during the  academic semester in which the course was taken. However, if the instructor agrees, a  grade of “I” (incomplete) may be given when a student has been unable to complete the  work of a course. However, the work completed up to that date must be of passing quality  and the grade of incomplete provides no undue advantage to that student over other  students.    By awarding an “I” grade, an instructor must specify the requirements for the completion  of the work and designate a default letter grade in the event that the student fails to  complete the remaining work.    Students must complete the required course work by no later than the end of the  following academic semester or sooner if required by the instructor.      21The instructor must record the permanent course grade by the last day of the  examination period of the following semester, or the Registrar will automatically assign  the default grade.    If further work has not been completed after one semester and a default grade is  rendered, the default grade will become the grade of record.  3.3.19 Change of grades and missing grades  If a grade has been assigned in error, it can be changed to a different permanent grade.  The procedure for changing a grade is as follows:   Discuss the matter with the course instructor; provide evidence that the grade issued  was not the grade earned.   If the instructor agrees, the student should contact the program administrator to  process a Change of Grade Form in order to correct the grade that was issued in error.  Generally, the instructor is the final authority for a course grade.   If a grade has not been assigned, please notify the course instructor for the  completion of a Missing Grade Form.  3.3.20 Qualifying examinations and procedures (or equivalent)  None required.  3.3.21 Thesis/dissertation  None required.  3.3.22 On transfer to another program  If the requirements for the MCDS degree have not been completed when a student leaves  to pursue another academic program, the degree will not be awarded. Completion of the  MCDS degree does not guarantee admission into any doctoral degree program at  Carnegie Mellon University. The courses that will be completed as part of the MCDS may  serve to enhance one’s application to these programs but will in no way insure  admittance.  3.3.23 Intellectual property policy  The MCDS degree program adheres to Carnegie Mellon University policy on intellectual  property: http://www.cmu.edu/policies/documents/IntellProp.html   3.3.24 Teaching requirements  None required. However, students are encouraged to apply for teaching assistant  positions in courses where they have excelled.  3.3.25 Language proficiency requirements  None required. However, non-native English speakers are encouraged to take advantage  of the various support functions provided by the Intercultural Communication Center  (ICC) and the Global Communication Center (GCC).    223.3.26 Academic Integrity and Policies on Plagiarism and Cheating  The university considers any form of cheating or plagiarism to be a serious violation of  student ethics. The student is required to understand and rigorously follow only the  permitted forms of collaboration as defined by the instructor in every class. The work  you submit must be your own, unless you have clearly attributed it to others. You must  not use the work of others without proper citation. And, you must not use resources,  including other persons, except as authorized by the course or project for which you are  submitting the work. Such conduct might be accepted or commonplace elsewhere, but it  is not here. Be careful. Be warned. Failure to abide by these rules, even just once, can  result in your permanent separation from the University without refund of money paid.  Note that the policy requires the student to be informed and understand the academic  integrity rules for every assignment or exam in a course.    The MCDS program strives to produce graduates with the highest standards of academic  integrity. Academic Integrity Violations are taken very seriously and the MCDS program  has a zero tolerance policy for multiple Academic Integrity Violations. A single violation  is grounds for dismissal from the graduate program if deemed sufficiently egregious as  determined by the MCDS program committee. If a student commits a second violation,  the expected penalty is dismissal from the graduate program (see also academic progress  review at section 3.3.17).    Please review the University Policy on Academic Integrity:  https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/academic-integrity.html    The policy includes the University expectations around academic integrity and  provides definitions of cheating, plagiarism, and unauthorized assistance.    A review of the University’s Academic Disciplinary Actions procedures  https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/theword/academic-discipline/index.html   is also  recommended. These procedures outline the process for investigating, reporting, and  adjudicating violations of the University Policy on Academic Integrity. The procedures  also outline the appeal process.    3.3.27 Process for Appealing Final Grades   https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/theword/academic/appeal-of-grades-and-academic-actions.html     Final grades will be changed only in exceptional circumstances and only with the  approval of the instructor and the department, unit or program. Grading is a matter of  sound discretion of the instructor and final grades are rarely changed without the consent  of the instructor who assigned the grade. The following circumstances are the unusual  exceptions that may warrant a grade appeal: (a) the final grade assigned for a course is  based on manifest error (e.g. a clear error such as arithmetic error in computing a grade  or failure to grade one of the answers on an exam), or (b) the faculty or staff member who  assigned the grade did so in violation of a University policy.    233.3.27 Teaching Assistants  The MCDS degree does not have a teaching requirement. However, some students may  wish to be a teaching assistant. MCDS students may petition for approval to TA up to one  course per semester provided that they are in good academic standing (Overall QPA 3.0  or above).    As required by the English Fluency in Higher Education Act of 1990, graduate students  are required to have a certain level of fluency in English before they can instruct in  Pennsylvania. Through this Act, all institutions of higher education in the state are  required to evaluate and certify the English fluency of all instructional personnel,  including teaching assistants and interns.    The full university policy can be reviewed at:    http://www.cmu.edu/policies/faculty/evaluation-certification-english-fluency- instructors.html .    In addition to administering the International Teaching Assistant (ITA) Test (mandatory  screening test for any non-native speaker of English), Language Support in the Student  Academic Success Center helps teaching assistants who are non-native English speakers  develop fluency and cultural understanding to teach successfully at Carnegie Mellon.  Visit the website for additional information: https://www.cmu.edu/student-success/   3.3.28 Internship Requirement and Search for Full Time Employment  An internship is required for the degree program. In some cases, when a student has  prior work experience, the Director of the degree program may waive this requirement.  Students start searching for internships generally in the Fall and Spring semesters. Once  the student returns from an internship in the Fall, they should immediately begin the  search for full time employment. Extensive resources are available at  http://www.cmu.edu/career/  including a resume submission system, a list of employers,  on campus interviews and mock interviews, and many other resources.    The Technical Opportunities Conference (TOC)  http://engineering.cmu.edu/companies/toc/  occurs every September. This conference is  one of the main recruiting events each year.    All international students are required to apply for Curricular Practical Training (CPT).  CPT is employment that is an integral part of an established curriculum and is directly  related to the student’s major area of study. Please visit the Office of International  Education (OIE) link below to learn more about the CPT process:  http://www.cmu.edu/oie/forstu/jobs.html        243.4 Enrollment Verification  Enrollment Services is the only University office that can provide an official letter of  enrollment, official transcript and enrollment verification. Enrollment verification can  be requested online through The HUB via this link:  http://www.cmu.edu/hub/transcripts/verifications/enrollment.html       3.5 University Policies on Grades and Grading  3.6.1 University Policy on Grades  This policy offers details concerning university grading principles for students taking  courses and covers the specifics of assigning and changing grades, grading options,  drop/withdrawals and course repeats. It also defines the undergraduate and graduate  grading standards.    You can review the university grading policies here:  https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/grading.html    3.6.2 University Policy on Grades for Transfer Courses  Carnegie Mellon University offers students the opportunity to take courses for credit  through a cross-registration program (see Pittsburgh Council on Higher Education  (PCHE) and Cross-registration below) and through the receipt of transfer credit from  other accredited institutions. The Carnegie Mellon University transcript will include  information on such courses as follows: Carnegie Mellon courses and courses taken  through the university’s cross-registration program will have grades recorded on the  transcript and be factored into the QPA. All other courses will be recorded on this  transcript indicating where the course was taken, but without grades. Such courses will  not be taken into account for academic actions, honors or QPA calculations. (Note:  suspended students may take courses elsewhere; however, they may receive transfer  credit only if their college’s and department’s policies allow this.)    You can review the university policy here:  https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/transfer-credit-evaluation-and- assignment.html      3.6 Academic Integrity  3.7.1 Expectations Regarding Proper Conduct  In the midst of self-exploration, the high demands of a challenging academic  environment can create situations where some students have difficulty exercising good  judgment. Academic challenges can provide many opportunities for high standards to  evolve if students actively reflect on these challenges and if the community supports    25discussions to aid in this process. It is the responsibility of the entire community to  establish and maintain the integrity of our university.     Carnegie Mellon University educates its students to become professionals who will serve  society with integrity. The university also creates and disseminates new knowledge and  expressions of knowledge in ways that benefit society. Carnegie Mellon strives to serve  the changing needs of society through the three primary goals outlined in its mission  statement: to create and disseminate knowledge and art through research and artistic  expression, teaching and learning and transfer to society, to serve students by teaching  them leadership and problem-solving skills, and the values of quality, ethical behavior,  responsibility to society and commitments to work, to pursue the advantages provided by  a diverse community, open to the exchange of ideas, where discovery and artistic  creativity can flourish.    In any presentation, creative, artistic or research, it is the ethical responsibility of each  student to identify the conceptual sources of the work submitted. Failure to do so is  dishonest and is the basis for a charge of cheating or plagiarism, which is subject to  disciplinary action.     Please review the University Policy on Academic Integrity  (https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/academic-integrity.html ). The  policy includes the University expectations around academic integrity and provides  definitions of cheating, plagiarism, and unauthorized assistance.    A review of the University’s Academic Disciplinary Actions procedures  (https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/theword/academic-discipline/index.html ) is also  recommended. These procedures outline the process for investigating, reporting, and  adjudicating violations of the University Policy on Academic Integrity. The procedures  also outline the appeal process.    3.7.2 Protocol for Academic Integrity Violations  The university has a very clear and specific protocol for responding to alleged violations  of academic integrity. Carnegie Mellon's Academic Disciplinary Actions Overview for  Graduate Students describes procedures and the appeal process for disciplinary actions  against graduate students in cases of alleged academic integrity violation.    For more information on disciplinary actions please see:    https://www.cmu.edu/student- affairs/theword/acad_standards/creative/disciplinary.html     Further documentation on how to respond to an allegation of a violation as a graduate  student:    26  https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/ocsi/academic-integrity/grads.html      Important Note: MCDS implements the above policy’s option of “conven[ing] a  disciplinary hearing according to the procedures of the department/program”. We have  adopted the following hearing procedure and “two strikes” rule:   If an instructor determines that an academic integrity violation has occurred,  both the instructor and students are given the opportunity to explain the situation  to the MCDS program committee. A written hearing by email suffices for this  purpose.   The program committee then reviews all information and decides whether the  violation is deemed an infraction (see 3.3.17), and which secondary actions are to  be taken on the program level.   Two-Strike-Rule: MCDS may dismiss students upon a first AIV infraction. A  second infraction will always lead to the offending student being dismissed from  the program, with no exceptions.    The MCDS program reserves the right to withdraw a degree even though it has been  granted should there be discovery that the work upon which it was based or the academic  records in support of it had been falsified. In such a case, the degree will be withdrawn  promptly upon discovery of the falsification. The complete reference to this university  policy is available at:  https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student- life/withdrawal-of-a-degree.html   4 Academic Policies  4.1 MCDS Academic Policies  4.1.1 Duration of Study  MCDS students enrolled for full-time studies are normally expected to complete the  degree in three semesters (16 months). This includes a summer internship.  4.1.2 Double-Dipping  A Masters student who uses courses taken as part of another degree program (at  Carnegie Mellon or elsewhere) toward their program requirements cannot use those  same courses toward any other M.S. degree offered by the School of Computer Science  without prior approval.  4.1.3 Pass/Fail and Audit Grades  Pass/fail and audit grades are not permitted for courses used to satisfy a degree  requirement. Graduate students who are required to take additional undergraduate  courses to build up the core foundations of computer science may not elect the pass/fail  or audit option for these courses.    274.1.4 Transfer Credit  An equivalent graduate course previously completed at Carnegie Mellon, or another  institution, may be permitted to satisfy one of the MCDS course requirements, with  permission from the Director. Students must petition for transfer credit by providing  the Program Director with the prior course syllabus and other details that may be  required by the Director in order to make a decision. See the section on “Definition of  transfer credit versus course exemption”. NOTE: In all cases, credit may only be  transferred from another degree program for courses deemed “free electives” - i.e.,  courses which were not used to satisfy a core requirement or total units requirement in  a prior degree program.    All MS students are required to take a minimum of 96 units of coursework at CMU.  4.1.5 External Internships and Job Interviewing  MCDS students are expected to attain an external internship during the summer.  International students must coordinate carefully with the University, due to visa  restrictions. International students are required to consult with the Office of  International Education for eligibility before seeking an internship/co-op or signing an  offer contract.    We caution all students to be aware of potential intellectual property (IP) implications  with internships, and to review any IP agreements with their academic advisor before  signing them. It is possible to lose ownership of your own inventions if they occur during  an external internship.    While it is necessary for students to travel off-campus for job interviews, it is not  acceptable for a student to miss a course requirement or a capstone project commitment  due to interview travel. Students should work proactively with prospective employers to  arrange interview travel in a way that minimizes the impact on their final semester  course work.  4.1.6 Transferring into the MCDS Program  Direct transfers into the MCDS program are not permitted. Students who are currently  enrolled at Carnegie Mellon who wish to transfer into the MCDS program must do so by  applying to the MCDS program via the normal admissions process. As specified in Sec.  4.1.4 in this document, some transfer credit and/or exemption from MCDS requirements  may be possible on a case-by-case basis.  4.1.7 Transferring Out of the MCDS Program  The MCDS program does not prevent students from transferring to another degree  program. Each degree program has its own rules about whether and when transfers into  the program are permitted. A student that is interested in transferring out of the MCDS  degree program should consult the handbook and Program Director of the desired    28degree program to learn whether transfers are permitted, and if so, how and when to  request such a transfer.  4.1.8 Statute of Limitations  https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/masters-students-statute-of-  limitations.html      As outlined in the Master’s Students Statute of Limitations (link above), students will  complete all requirements for the master’s degree within a maximum of seven years  from original matriculation as a master’s student, or less if required by a more restrictive  department, school or college policy. Once this time-to-degree limit has lapsed, the  person may resume work towards a master’s degree only if newly admitted to a currently  offered master’s degree program under criteria determined by that program.    Under extraordinary circumstances, such as leave of absence, military or public service,  family or parental leave, or temporary disability, a school or college may, upon the  relevant department's recommendation and with the written approval of the dean (or  designate), defer the lapse for a period commensurate with the duration of that  interruption. Students who are pursuing a master’s degree as part-time students for all  semesters of their program, as approved by their program, may also appeal to their  program or department for extension of the time to degree limit.  4.2 LTI Academic Policies  4.2.1 “Grandfather” policy  A student can graduate under the policies in effect at the time that the student entered  the program; or, at the student's choice, the student can graduate under policies that are  adopted after the student entered the program. In unusual cases, the Director may  approve exceptions to the program requirements.  4.2.2 Course Drop/Add/withdrawal procedures  Students taking undergraduate and Master’s level courses must follow the procedures and  deadlines for adding, dropping, or withdrawing from courses as identified on the  academic calendar. Information can be found at:   https://www.cmu.edu/hub/registrar/course-changes/index.html .    There is a separate calendar for masters level courses.     4.2.3 Courses with restricted enrollment  MCDS students have priority for the program core courses. The MCDS program  administrators cannot intercede with other departments to secure seats for its students  in other courses as all departments reserve seats for their accepted students. Usually all  remaining open seats are assigned on a first- come, first-served basis.  Students can,    29on occasion, contact the assigned course instructor in order to plead his/her case for  admission to the course. Admission may be granted at the discretion of the instructor.  The policy of the department offering the course(s) is always followed.  4.2.4 Definition of transfer credit versus course exemption  The LTI may grant transfer credit or issue an exemption for equivalent graduate courses  previously completed at another institution. This decision rests with the Director of the  particular program. If a student is exempt from a required course due to prior courses or  experience, the student can replace that course with an open elective. The student does  not receive credit for the external course but can take any course that could normally  count toward the degree in its place. If a student receives credit for prior coursework  completed at CMU or elsewhere, the student receives that many units of credit, and the  total amount of required coursework is reduced by that amount.  4.2.5 External Employment/Consulting  Since the MCDS program places heavy demands on student time, external employment  and/or consulting are strongly discouraged. Exceptional students who wish to consult  should discuss this with their advisor. International students must also have approval in  advance from the Office of International Education (OIE) for any outside employment.  4.2.6 Leave of Absence  A student in good standing may be granted a LOA of at most 1 year, upon written request  to the Program Director and with consent of the student's advisor. It is the responsibility  of the student on LOA to contact the program administrator to apply for a return to the  program.  4.2.7 Withdrawal from Program  Students may voluntarily withdraw from the MCDS program. If a student decides to  withdraw, or is considering a withdrawal, she/he should contact the program  administrator to schedule an advising meeting as soon as possible.     The university’s general withdrawal policy can be found here:    https://www.cmu.edu/hub/registrar/leaves-and-withdrawals/    4.2.8 Satisfactory Progress  If a student does not make satisfactory progress each semester toward completing the  degree, the LTI may remove the student from the program. See section on “End of  Semester Evaluation”. In particular, students in the three-semester program who fail one  of their first-semester MCDS core required courses are strongly encouraged to consider  switching to the four-semester program.  4.2.9 Winter and Summer Breaks    30Students supported by research projects or working in an on-campus internship are  expected to remain on campus working during breaks in classes. A two-week vacation is  typically allowed in the summer for the students who are working on campus (not  pursuing an external internship). Supported students should arrange their winter break  time with their supervisor.    4.3 CMU Academic Policies   4.3.1 Assistance for Individuals with Disabilities   http://www.cmu.edu/education-office/disability-resources/    The Office of Disability Resources at Carnegie Mellon University has a continued mission  to provide physical, digital, and programmatic access to ensure that students with  disabilities have equal access to their educational experience. We work to ensure that  qualified individuals receive reasonable accommodations as guaranteed by the  Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.  Students who would like to receive accommodations can begin the process through  Disability Resources' secure online portal   (https://rainier.accessiblelearning.com/cmu/ ) or email access@andrew.cmu.edu to  begin the interactive accommodation process.    Students with physical, sensory, cognitive, or emotional disabilities are encouraged to  self-identify with the Office of Disability Resources and request needed accommodations.  Any questions about the process can be directed to access@andrew.cmu.edu, or call (412)  268-6121.  4.3.2 Summary of Graduate Student Appeal and Grievance Procedures   Graduate students will find the Summary of Graduate Student Appeal and Grievance  Procedures on the Graduate Education Resource webpage. This document summarizes  processes available to graduate students who seek review of academic and non-academic  issues. Generally, graduate students are expected to seek informal resolution of all  concerns within the applicable department, unit or program before invoking formal  processes. When an informal resolution cannot be reached, however, a graduate student  who seeks further review of the matter is to follow the formal procedures outlined here.  These appeal and grievance procedures shall apply to students in all graduate programs  of the University. Students should refer to the department specific information in this  handbook for department and college information about the administration and  academic policies of the program.     You can review a summary of the university’s graduate student’s appeal and grievance  procedures here:  https://www.cmu.edu/graduate/policies/appeal-grievance-procedures.html   4.3.3 Safeguarding Educational Equity: Sexual Harassment and Sexual Assault     31The University prohibits sex-based discrimination, sexual harassment, sexual assault,  dating/ domestic violence and stalking.

164	So what's the difference between tartan and plaid?  You'll know it's a tartan if... • "It's a check or pattern in a variety of colours in woven fabric in which bands of colour are repeated in equal proportion in warp (running lengthwise) and weft (running across)." • "Each stripe of the warp crosses every stripe of the weft, so when vertical and horizontal stripes of the same color cross, the result is solid color at the point of intersection." • "The arrangement of colored threads is the same in the warp as in the weft."  You can find our official tartan on various items in the University Store.  Source: "Tartan: Romancing the Plaid," by Jeffrey Banks and Doria De La Chapelle

Many MLT grads continue on to Ph.D. programs at CMU and other top institutions, while others pursue careers at companies emphasizing research and rapid innovation. Requirements: The MLT program lasts two years (24 months), and students must complete two summers of research. Students should usually expect to graduate in August of their second year. MLT students take 120 or more course units (about 10 courses), at least 72 of which are LTI courses, and 24 of which are School of Computer Science (SCS) courses. Most of these are 12-unit courses, although lab courses are typically 6 units. Our courses generally assume knowledge of programming and data structures. The remaining units may also be taken from the LTI, or with approval from the faculty advisor, any other senior- or graduate-level course offered at CMU or Pitt. Directed research is another integral part of the MLT program; MLT students carry out directed research during their studies, with guidance from their faculty advisors. Students may also choose to complete an optional MLT thesis. Guidelines can be found in the MLT Handbook. Curriculum: Here's an example of how your two years in the MLT program may break down.  Year 1 Fall: - Grammars and Lexicons - Algorithms for NLP - Directed Study  Year 1 Spring: - Search Engines or Machine Learning for Text Mining - Machine Translation - Self-Paced Lab - Directed Study  Year 1 Summer: - Required Research   Year 2 Fall: - Software Engineering for LT (I) - Speech Understanding - Self-Paced Lab - Directed Study  Year 2 Spring: - Software Engineering for LT (II) - Directed Study - Elective  Year 2 Summer: - Required Research  Admission: Carnegie Mellon's School of Computer Science has a centralized online application process.

Although students have dressed as a Scottish terrier — typically referred to as Scotty — for 50 years, it wasn't until 2007 that Carnegie Mellon officially welcomed the Scottish terrier as the university's first mascot.  In keeping with tradition, students, faculty, staff and alumni voted to name the new official mascot Scotty. But it's not just the costumed mascot that voters named. The live dog is also known as Scotty to the Carnegie Mellon community.

Welcome to the Language Technologies Institute. While this handbook (and your college  graduate student handbook) is specific to your academic experience in the LTI, there are several other resources and offices that graduate students are encouraged to consult during their tenure at Carnegie Mellon University. Information about The Word, the student handbook, the  Office of Graduate and Postdoc Affairs, the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs, and others,  are included in Appendix A of this handbook.   1.2 The MLT Degree   The Master of Language Technologies (MLT) is a research- oriented Master of Science degree  offered by the Language Technologies Institute (LTI), a graduate department in the School of  Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University.  The MLT program is a 24 -month program  consisting of courses, directed research, and an optional Masters ' Thesis.  Typical research  areas include speech processing, information retrieval, machine translation, natural language  processing, machine learning, and computational biology.  Many MLT graduates continue on to PhD programs in the LTI or other leading universities.  Other graduates  go on to work in the  computer industry, many at major corporate research laboratories.   There are significant differences between CMU's different departments and degree programs in philosophical approach, procedures, policies , and regulations. Each departm ent issues a  handbook that informs graduate students of their program requirements and procedures and ensures that students have written access to the standard information outlined below. This handbook describes the policies, procedures, and requirements for the Master of Language Technologies (MLT) degree.   While this handbook is specific to your academic experience in the department, there are several other resources and offices graduate students are encouraged to consult during their  tenure at Carnegie Me llon University.  Information about The Word, Carnegie Mellon University  Student Handbook , the Office of the Assistant Vice Provost for Graduate Education, the Office  of the Dean of Student Affairs and others are included in Appendix A of this handbook.   All policies not explicitly described in this document conform to School of Computer Science  (SCS) policies and university policies described in The Word, Carnegie Mellon University Student Handbook  and at the University Policies website.

These standards require personal integrity, a commitment to honesty without compromise, as well as truth without equivocation and a willingness to place the good of the community above the good of the self. Obligations once undertaken must be met, commitments kept.    As members of the Carnegie Mellon community, individuals are expected to uphold the standards of the community in addition to holding others accountable for said standards. It is rare that the life of a student in an academic community can be so private that it will not affect the community as a whole or that the above standards do not apply.    The discovery, advancement and communication of knowledge are not possible without a  commitment to these standards. Creativity cannot exist without acknowledgment of the  creativity of others. New knowledge cannot be developed without credit for prior knowledge. Without the ability to trust that these principles will be observed, an academic community cannot exist.   The commitment of its faculty, staff and students to these standards contributes to the high respect in which the Carnegie Mellon degree is held. Students must not destroy that respect by their failure to meet these standards. Students who cannot meet them should voluntarily withdraw from the university.   The Carnegie Mellon Code can also be found on -line at  http://www.cmu.edu/student- affairs/theword/code.html   1.7 Vision   Carnegie Mell on University will have a transformative impact on society through continual  innovation in education, research, creativity, and entrepreneurship.        MLT Graduate Student Handbook  Page 10   1.8 Mission   To create a transformative educational experience for students focused on deep disciplinary  knowl edge; problem solving; leadership, communication, and interpersonal skills; and personal  health and well -being.  To cultivate a transformative university community dedicated to a) attracting and retaining diverse, world -class talent; b) creating a collaborative environment open to the free exchange  of ideas, where research, creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship can flourish; and c) ensuring individuals can achieve their full potential.   To impact society in a transformative way —regionally, nationally, and globally —by engaging  with partners outside the traditional borders of the university campus.   1.9 Consensual Intimate Relationship Policy Regarding Undergraduate  Students  This policy addresses the circumstances in which romantic, sexual, or amorous  relation ships/interactions with undergraduate students, even if consensual, are inappropriate  and prohibited. The purpose of this policy is to assure healthy professional relationships. This policy is not intended to discourage consensual intimate relationships unless there is a  conflicting professional relationship in which one party has authority over the other as in the policy.   https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/consensual-relationships.html   2 The Language Technologies Institute   2.1 Mailboxes & Office Supplies   Mailboxes, printers, copiers, and other departmental resources are  in GHC 5404.   2.2 Photocopies and Printers   The use of a photocopier or printer requires you to log in with your CMU ID card. LTI’s printers are located in GHC 5404 and GHC 66 04. The School of Computer Science provides a number of  black -and- white and color printers for use by students.  The  SCS Computer Facilities publishes a  list of printers online at http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~help/printing/ .    MLT Graduate Student Handbook  Page 11   2.3 Office Space for MS Students   To help them create a sense of com munity, full time students in the LTI’s MLT program have  access to a shared office space .  2.4 Computers for MS Students   Students are expected to provide their own laptop computers that can be used to access  university resources an d complete course assignments.  Laptops running Windows, MacOS, and  Linux software are all acceptable.   MS students will be given a CS user ID . A CS user ID  is required to use the LTI computer cluster,  department printers, and other SCS services. The School of Computer Science has a Help  Center  located at 4203 GHC.  They can be contacted at help@cs.cmu.edu, extension 8 -4231 from a  campus phone, or 412 -268- 4231 from an outside line.   MS students will be given access to the LTI’s computer cluster on an as -needed basis, to be  used for course assignments, directed study projects , and/or capstone projects. The LTI cluster  provides storage and computation for projects involving large datasets and/or lengthy computation.   3 Master’s Degree Completion and Certification   3.1 Standard Degree Requirements an d Degree Certification   3.1.1 Graduate Students   Carnegie Mellon graduate students are expected to complete their degree requirements within the standard length of time for their program of study as outlined in the relevant Graduate  Student Handbook. Standard prog ram lengths for graduate students vary significantl y-- ranging  from two semesters for some full -time master’s programs to several or more years for doctoral  programs. Upon completion of the graduate program degree requirements, the degree will be  certified by the student’s academic program in the semester in which the student completes the requirements.   3.1.2 Early Completion   Graduate students who consider the completion of all degree requirements in less than the  standard length of time for their program of study may consult with their degree -granting  program or department to determine if early degree certification is allowed and under what  circumstances.  MLT Graduate Student Handbook  Page 12   3.1.3 Extended or Longer -than -Standard Completion (Statute of Limitations)   Longer -than -standard degree completion may occur due to academic interruptions in making  progress toward the degree as defined by the academic  program, interruptions of full -time  study or progress towards the degree due to  serious, documented medical iss ues, or other  unusual or unforeseen  circumstances.   Master’s students who require longer than the standard time to complete their  degree  requirements are expected to remain in close contact with their  graduate program, and will be  certified at the end of the semester in which they  have completed their degree requirements.  Students shall reference CMU Policy on Master’s Student Statute of Limitations  (www.cmu.edu/policies/student- and- student- life/masters -students -statute -of limitations.html)  regarding gu idelines and restrictions which place an upper limit on the maximum length of time  allowable for master’s degree completion and  certification.   3.1.4 Additional Guidance for Students  • Program of Study: Students seeking guidance about their program of study and degree  requirements should consult with their academic advisor and/ or appropriate  associate  dean.   • Financial Aid and Student Account: Students are expected to make normal progress   toward their degree to  graduate within the standard timeframe for their program of  study. Under U.S. Federal Title IV regulations, student eligibility  for federal financial aid  is contingent upon enrollment in and successful  completion of courses that are counted  as credit toward their current degree program. To receive  the maximum amount of  federal financial aid for which they may be eligible, students must enroll each semester  in at least 36 units  that count toward their current degree level. (See separate guidance  regarding  integrated degree completion.) Students s hould consult with their designated  college liaison in The HUB regarding  billing and financial aid, particularly for early  completion, longer -than standard completion, or integrated undergraduate and  master’s degree programs .    • International Students: Im migration status for students in F -1 and J -1 non -immigrant  status is tied to making normal progress toward completing degree requirements .  Therefore, F -1 and J -1 students who are considering completing their  degree  requirements early, anticipating longer- than- standard completion, or moving from an  undergraduate to a graduate student classification ( integrated undergraduate -graduate  study) should consult with their designated  advisor in the Office of International Education (OIE) to ensure compliance wi th  immigration regulations.    MLT Graduate Student Handbook  Page 13   4 MLT Degree Attainment   4.1 Course Requirements   In order to  complete the Master of Language Technologies degree, the student must pass 120  or more course units of senior- to-graduate courses, and meet the following criteria:   • within those 120 units, at least 72 units of “LTI” courses and 24 units of “SCS” courses,  • within those 72 units, 11 -711, 11- 791 (or an equivalent , see below ), and one ``Task  Orientation Focus'' class, and   • within those 72 units, at least one of the following:   o an LTI lab course,   o 11-792, or   o project -oriented Masters ’ thesis;   • Of the remaining 24 unit s, 12 must be 11- 910 Directed Research ;  • The final 12 units are an Open Elective.   The student must also complete two summers of full -time directed research, attend the LTI  Colloquium (11 -700) each semester, and satisfy the Research Speaking Requirement desc ribed  elsewhere.   Since 11 -791 is not being offered currently, the faculty have defined a list of acceptable  substitute courses:   • 11-727: Computational Semantics for NLP ( only if the course project was done as a  group project)    • 11-731: Machine Translation   • 11-747: Neural Networks for NLP   • 11-751:  Speech Recognition   • 11-775:  Large -Scale Multimedia   • 11-776: Multimodal Affective Computing   • 11-777: Multimodal Machine Learning   • 11-785:  Deep Learning   • 11-797: Question Answering     Students may request to have other  LTI course s with a group engineering project component to  be added to this list.    For definitions of quoted terms, see the section on “Definitions of LTI Terminology .”  Unless approved by the Program Director in advance, t he course requirements must be  satisfied by actual classroom courses, not credit given for research or independent study.  MLT Graduate Student Handbook  Page 14   Note that a Masters ’ Thesis is not required in general, although a thesis project may be used to  satisfy the “lab” requirement.     4.1.1 Grade Requirements   Students must demonstrate their mastery of material taught in courses and their success in  applying their skills in directed study by satisfying the following grade requirements:   1. Minimum grade:  Only courses with a grade of C (2.0) or higher are counted as satisfying a degree requirement.   2. Pass/fail:   Pass/fail grades are not permitted for courses and projects used to satisfy a  degr ee requirement.   4.1.2 Research Speaking Requirement   To emphasize student research, improve public speaking skills , and increase internal awareness  of LTI work, all MLT students must complete an oral presentation in their second year (by the  end of May). The presentation should consist of a 20 -minute talk plus time for discussion. It  must be advertised to the LTI mailing lists at least one week before your presentation, and the  public will be invited.   At least two CMU faculty members will attend the presentation, including the research advisor.  After the presentation, these faculty members will convene and provide written feedback to both the student and the chair of graduate programs (the form for this is available on the LTI website). This feedback will help the student refine speaking skills with respect to talk structure, content, and delivery.   4.1.3 Withdrawal of a Degree   The University reserves the right to withdraw a degree even though it has been granted should  there be discovery that the work upon which it was based or the academic records in support of  it had been falsified. In such a case, withdrawal of the degree will occur promptly upon discovery of the falsification. The complete reference to this University policy is available at https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student- life/withdrawal- of-a-degree.html .   4.2 Advising   Each student has a faculty advisor charged with guiding the education and monitoring the  progress of the student through the program. The advisor also supervises the student's directed  study projects. This personal student- advisor relationship ensures that every student receives  the necessary faculty mentoring. The advisor also provides the student with career advice.  MLT Graduate Student Handbook  Page 15   How and when the advisor is selected: the Marriage Process:  Advisors are selected during the  first month of the program. Students are expected to attend the LTI's Orientation (“Immigration  Course ,” or IC) lectures, in which faculty describe their interests and areas of expertise, and to  be proactive about meeting individually with potential advisors. After meeting with several  potential advisors, each student will be asked to indicate a firs t, second, and third choice for  advisor. Meanwhile, the potential advisors determine how many new students they can take,  and indicate their preferences. Finally, the  entire LTI faculty meets as a “ Marriage Committee ”  to determine the best set of matches.   Some entering MLT students are prefunded, meaning they have received and accepted a funding letter from a faculty member before the Marriage Process. (Even students who are prefunded must attend the research talks, to become acquainted with the LTI’s rese arch  projects.) Even self -supporting MLT students are expected to perform research with a faculty  advisor, since research experience is an important part of our graduate programs. Until a student finds a specific advisor, the chair of the LTI graduate prog rams serves as the advisor.   How to change advisors:  The initial advisor selection should be made carefully. However, it is  possible to change advisors. To do so, the student should find another faculty member willing  to serve as an advisor, and then make a  request to the Program Director to switch advisors. The  LTI follows the long -standing SCS policy that both the new and old advisors need to agree to the  change; typically, this is not a problem ( assuming the new advisor has agreed in advance, as  described  here ). It is to the student's advantage to avoid switching advisors, especially late in  their graduate studies, because forging a strong student- advisor relationship takes time.   4.3 Optional Masters’  Thesis   MLT students may optionally  elect to complete a Mast ers’ Thesis; it is not  required. Students  who intend to apply for the PhD program should consider the MLT Thesis as one of several  ways to demonstrate their research potential. Other possibilities include innovative research in a research project or class project work.   The MLT Thesis must be completed according to the following guidelines. Note in particular the October 31 proposal deadline!   • There are two course components required for students who elect to complete the M.S. Thesis: 11 -928 – Masters ’ Thesis I (with the chosen thesis advisor, typically for 12 units,  typically in the Fall of their second year) and 11 -929 – Masters ’ Thesis II in the following  Spring.   • Each of these two courses counts towards 6 units of MLT -level LTI course credit; if the  student goes on to an LTI PhD, the second course (11 -929) counts towards one PhD lab  requirement.    • The MLT thesis may focus on either a significant research result or a significant implementation of a new technology. The student should work with their adv isor to  define an interesting but bounded thesis research project. The MLT thesis culminates in MLT Graduate Student Handbook  Page 16   a publication -quality paper that clearly describes the work in terms of its research  significance.   • The MLT thesis committee will be composed of a thesis advisor  and two additional  readers, to be chosen by the student in consultation with the advisor, during the Fall  Masters ’ Thesis I course. At least 2  of the 3 committee members must be SCS faculty  working in Language Technologies.   • To receive a final grade for the first semester's course, the student must have prepared a written proposal of at least five pages, describing the scientific thesis to be investigated, any relevant research already completed by the student, a comparison  with related work by others, and a detailed description of the work to be done in the  next semester. The proposal MUST be accepted by the committee by the end of  October , or the student will not be allowed to enroll in 11 -929 – Masters ’ Thesis II!   • Sometime d uring the semester when the student enrolls in 11 -929 – Masters ’ Thesis II  (typically, their final semester), the student will distribute a draft of the thesis to the committee for initial review. This should be done as early as feasible, to avoid last - minute surprises that could delay final approval of the thesis.   • The thesis work culminates in submission of the final version of the thesis document, followed by a public presentation of the work in an LTI seminar (or other suitable public forum). Since the defense is public, the LTI graduate program administrator must receive all the information required for a public announcement at least one week before the defense. The Masters ’ Thesis presentation is somewhat less rigorous than a PhD  thesis defense. The pre sentation must communicate the research work done, similar to  a conference paper presentation. The committee will observe the presentation, and then decide whether the thesis and presentation were acceptable, or whether further  work is required. Unlike a P hD defense, only a simple majority vote of the committee is  required for approval.   • Although students are required to enroll in the appropriate course sequence of two Masters ’ Thesis courses, it is not required that students finish the thesis by the end of  that second semester. If a student requires more time to revise the thesis to the committee's satisfaction, and adequately present the work, an incomplete grade will be assessed in the Masters ’ Thesis course, until such time as the work and presentation ar e  accepted. The student will still be allowed to walk in Spring Commencement, if all other requirements for the MLT degree have been completed. Students should note that any financial support beyond the end of the semester will be on a case -by-case basis, and  must be arranged in advance with the project supporting them. Students are strongly encouraged to finish the thesis work within one (1) year following the semester they enroll for the first Masters ’ Thesis course.         MLT Graduate Student Handbook  Page 17   4.4 Definitions of LTI Terminology   We define here some of the terms as used in this handbook:   • An “LTI course” is any 12 -unit course with a number of 11 -XXX; a 6 -unit course with an  11-XXX counts as 1/2 of an LTI course. Unless otherwise specified, "course" means an  actual classroom course, not  credit given for research or independent study. Note that  we will allow any one MLD (10 -xxx) graduate- level course to count as an “LTI course.”   • An “SCS course” is any 12 -unit course with a course number indicating a unit of the  School of Computer Science (including LTI); a 6 -unit course with such a number counts  as 1/2 of an SCS course. Unless otherwise specified, "course" means an actual classroom  course, not credit given for research or independent study. Note: Recommended  electives that are technically outside  of the SCS now count towards this requirement; for  example, Dig ital Signal Processing in ECE. Please see the Program Director for approval  of electives as “SCS .”  • “LTI Focus Areas” are sets of courses defined on the LTI course webpage under “Course Categories .” If a student believes a new course should be added to a Focus Area, they  should notify the Chair of the LTI Graduate Programs. He will decide, with advice from faculty in the appropriate area, whether it should be in the Focus Area, and if approved it will be added to the LTI Focus Area webpage.   o A “Task -Orientation Focus Course” is simply a course belonging to that LTI Focus  Area, as listed on the “Course Categories” webpage.   • An LTI “lab course” is simply a course in the list of lab courses def ined in the LTI “Course  Categories” webpage.   4.5 Recommended Electives outside of SCS   Students are free to take elective courses outside the SCS, at Carnegie Mellon or cross - registered at the University of Pittsburgh, as long as the student fulfills the requi rements of  their program as described above. The student should discuss any such electives in advance with their advisor; typical choices might include ECE courses for Speech students, Pitt Linguistics courses, or Statistics courses.   Note: recommended electives outside of the SCS count towards the “SCS” course requirement. Please see the Program Director for approval of electives as “SCS. ”  Note also that students need advance approval for any courses not covered by their normal tuition (e.g., summer courses ). The grading of outside courses is the responsibility of the  department offering the course; however , the LTI's Minimum Course Grade Policy described  above still applies (“ B-” is the minimu m for PhD, “ C” for MLT).    MLT Graduate Student Handbook  Page 18   4.6 LTI Orientation   At the beginning of each  Fall semester, the LTI provides a set  of lectures and talks to help  students learn about the work done by CMU faculty and to provide an opportunity for advisors  to recruit new students.  Students are expected to attend them and treat them  seriously,  because they provide a good introduction to the broad range of research done at the LTI.   Students do not register for the LTI Orientation, nor do they receive  a grade;  however , the  department is serious about its expectation that new students will attend these talks.   For many years, these talks were called "the Immigration Course (IC)" , which caused confusion.   The older name has been retired;  however , people who have been at CMU a long time may  occasionally use the older name.     4.7 End of Semester  Evaluation  Near the end of the spring and fall  semester s, the student must prepare a statement that  describes their  achievements in the current semester, and plans for the next semester. At the  end of the semester, the faculty evaluates each student's academic progress. The student's advisor serves as the student's advocate in this process. The result of the evaluation is a letter from the faculty to the student that indicates whether the student is making satisfactory progress  towards completing the degre e.  A good letter  typically indicates that the student is making satisfactory progress. If the student  is doing exceptionally good work, a stronger adjective such as excellent  might be used, but this  is unusual.   If a student seems to be having trouble, the faculty determines whether it believes that the student can finish the degree, and if so, what needs to be accomplished to get back on track. This type of letter should be considered a serious warning. It is not a permanent “black mark”   on the student's record; if the student begins making satisfactory progress again, there is no official record of the letter in the student's transcript.   In the most serious cases, the faculty gives the student an N- 1 letter that specifies a list of  conditions that the student must satisfy by specific deadlines. Failure to meet all of the  specified conditions may result in the student's termination from the program.   4.8 Enrollment Verification   Enrollment Services is the only University office that can provide an official letter of enrollment,  official transcript and enrollment verification.  Enrollment verification can be requested online through The HUB at:   http://www.cmu.edu/hub/transcripts/verifications/enrollment.html .  MLT Graduate Student Handbook  Page 19   4.9 University Policies on Grades and Grading   4.9.1 University Policy on Grades   ww.cmu.edu/policies/documents/Grades.html   This policy offers details concerning university grading principles for students taking courses  and covers the speci fics of assigning and changing grades, grading options, drop/withdrawals,  and course repeats.  It also defines the undergraduate and graduate grading standards.   4.9.2 University Policy on Grades for Transfer Courses   www.cmu.edu/policies/documents/TransferCredit.html    Carnegie Mellon University offers students the opportunity to take courses for credit through a cross- registration program (see Pittsburgh Council on Higher Education (PCHE) and Cross - registration below) and through the receipt of transfer credit from other accredited institutions. The Carnegie Mellon University transcript will include information on such courses as follows: Carnegie Mellon cours es and courses taken through the university's cross -registration program  will have grades recorded on the transcript and be factored into the QPA. All other courses will be recorded on this transcript indicating where the course was taken, but without grade. Such courses will not be taken into account for academic actions, honors , or QPA calculations. (Note:  Suspended students may take courses elsewhere; however, they may receive transfer credit only if their college’s and department's policies allow this.)   4.10 Academic Integrity   Please review the University Policy on Academic Integrity:   https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student- life/academic -integrity.html   The policy includes the University expectations around academic integrity and provides definitions of cheating, plagiarism, and unauthorized assistance.   A review of the University’s Academic Disciplinary Actions procedures is also recommended. These procedures outline the process for investigating, reporting, and adjudicating violations of the University Policy on Academic Integrity. The procedures also outline the appeals process.   https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student- life/academic -integrity.html   In the midst of self- exploration, the high demands o f a challenging academic environment can  create situations where some students have difficulty exercising good judgment. Academic challenges can provide many opportunities for high standards to evolve if students actively reflect on these challenges and if the community supports discussions to aid in this process. It is  the responsibility of the entire community to establish and maintain the integrity of our  university. MLT Graduate Student Handbook  Page 20   Carnegie Mellon University educates its students to become professionals who will serve  society with integrity. The university also creates and disseminates new knowledge and expressions of knowledge in ways that benefit society. Carnegie Mellon strives to serve the changing needs of society through the three primary goals outlined in its mission statement: to  create and disseminate knowledge and art through research and artistic expression, teaching  and learning and transfer to society;  to serve students by teaching them leadership, problem- solving skills, and the values of quality, ethical behavior, responsibility to society and  commitments to work; and to pursue the advantages provided by a diverse community, open  to the exchange of ideas, where discovery and artistic creativity can flourish.   In any presentation, creative, artistic or resear ch, it is the ethical responsibility of each student  to identify the conceptual sources of the work submitted. Failure to do so is dishonest and is the basis for a charge of cheating or plagiarism, which is subject to disciplinary action.    The university has a very clear and specific protocol for responding to alleged violations of  academic integrity. Carnegie Mellon's Academic Disciplinary Actions Overview for Graduate  Students describes procedures for disciplinary actions against graduate students in case s of  alleged violations of academic regulations and the appeal process.  Please see https://www.cmu.edu/student- affairs/theword/academic -discipline/  for more information.   Important note:   The LTI implements the above policy’s option of “conven[ing] a disciplinary  hearing according to the procedures of the department/program.”  Our procedure is as follows:  a first violation is grounds for dismiss al from the graduate program. If we decide not to  immediately dismiss, the first violation will result in the student being on disciplinary probation.  If a student commits a second violation while on probation, the penalty is dismissal from the  graduate pr ogram.   5 Academic Policies   5.1 MLT Academic Policies   5.1.1 Duration of Study   MLT students enrolled for full -time study are expected to complete the degree in two calendar  years (24 months).  This includes two summers of full -time directed research.   See also the “ Statute of Lim itations” policy.   5.1.2 Double-Dipping  A Masters student who uses courses taken as part of another degree program (at Carnegie  Mellon or elsewhere) toward their program requirements cannot use those same courses MLT Graduate Student Handbook  Page 21   toward any other M.S. degree offered by the School of Computer Science without prior  approval. This is an SCS- wide policy.   5.1.3 Pass/Fail Grades   Pass/fail grades are not permitted for courses used to satisfy a degree requirement. Graduate  students who are required to take additional undergraduate courses to build up the core  foundations of computer science may not elect the pass/fail option for these courses.   5.1.4 Independent Study   For an Independent Study to satisfy a n MLT  student’s coursework requirements, it must be  approved by the MLT Program Director in advance .  In consultation with the CMU faculty  member who will be supervising the Independent Study, the student should produce a short (half -page to one page) description of the goals of the Independent Study, and how the results  will be evaluated, and submit it to the Program Director before the end of the Add period of the semester of the proposed study. The study should be planned so that it is finished in time for the supervising faculty member to give a grade at the end of the semester.  Independent studies may be undertaken for 6 or 12 units. Normally only one Independent Study would be  approved during a student’s MLT coursework.   5.1.5 Transfer Credit   An equivalent graduate course previously completed at another institution may be permitted to  satisfy one of the MLT course requirements. The decision on whether a course may be  transferred is made by the MLT Program Director. Typically , the student will provide the  Program Director with the syllabus of the external course, and the Program Director will use that and the student’s transcript to make the decision.   See the section on “Definition of transfer credit versus course exemption .”  All MLT students are required to take a minimum of 96 units of coursework at CMU.   5.1.6 External Internships  MLT students may only engage in internships if their advisors recommend it, since the program is 24 months, including summers. International students are required to consult with the Office  of International Education for eligibility before  seeking an internship/co -op or signing a n offer  contract.   We caution all students to be aware of potential intellectual property (IP) problems with internships, and to review any IP agreements with their advisors before signing them. It is possible to lose ownership of your ideas.   Important:  See also section 4.2.3, External Employment/Consulting.  MLT Graduate Student Handbook  Page 22   5.1.7 Transferring Into the MLT Program   Transfers into the MLT program are not permitted during a student’s first semester at CMU.  Students must begin their study at CMU in the program that admitted them; this  is a university  policy.   Students may request to transfer into the MLT program after completing their first semester. The student must make the request in writing (or email) to the MLT/PhD Admissions Chair. The  MLT/PhD Admissions Chair will inform the student about what application materials are  required;  for example, an explanation of why a transfer is desired, a proposed plan of study, a  proposed advisor, and CMU transcripts. Students that are already enrolled in an LTI degree program are not required to retake GRE and TOEFL exams or to produce new transcripts from other universities. The MLT program will conduct an expedited admissions process after receiving such a request.    5.1.8 Transferring Out of the MLT Program   The MLT program does not prevent students from transferring to another degree program. Each degree program has its own rules about whether and when transfers into the program are permitted. A student that is interested in transferring out of the MLT degree program should  consult the handbook and Pr ogram Director of the desired degree program to learn whether  transfers are permitted, and if so, how and when to request such a transfer.   5.1.9 Drop/Add/Withdraw Procedures   Students taking undergraduate and Masters’ level courses must follow the procedures and  deadlines for adding, dropping, and withdrawing from courses as identified on the academic  calendar. Information can be found at https://www.cmu.edu/hub/registrar/course- changes.index . Please note that there is a separate calendar for doctoral courses that does not  apply to Masters’ students.   5.1.10   Statute of Limitations   As outlined in the Master’s Students Statute of Limitations,  https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student- life/masters -students-statute- of-  limitations.html. Students will complete all requirements for the m a sters’ degree within a  maximum of seven years from original matriculation as a masters’  student, or less if required by  a more restrictive department, school, or college policy.  Once this time -to-degree limit has  lapsed, the person may resume work towards a masters’ degree only if newly admitted to a  currently offered master s’ degree program under criteria determined by that program.   See also the ‘Duration of Study’ policy.  MLT Graduate Student Handbook  Page 23   5.1.11   Teaching Requirements   MLT students do not normally serve as Teaching Assistants (TAs).  If an MLT student wants to  TA a course, they must get the approval of their research advisor.   In the unusual case of an MLT student TAing, note that graduate students are required to have a certain level of fluency in English before they can instruct in Pennsylvania, as required by the English Fluency in Higher Education Act of 1990. Through this Act, all institutions of higher  education in the state are required to evaluate and certify the English fluency of all instructional  personnel, including teaching assistants and interns. The full University policy can be reviewed at  https://www.cmu.edu/policies/faculty/evaluation- certification -english -fluency- instructors.html .  The fluency of all instructional personnel will be rated by Language Support in the S tudent  Academic Success Center to determine at what level of responsibility the student can TA. In addition to administering the International Teaching Assistant (ITA) Test (a mandatory screening for all non -native speakers of English), Language Support in the Student Academic  Success Center helps teaching assistants who are non- native English speakers develop fluency  and cultural understanding to teach successfully at Carnegie Mellon. Visit the Student Academic  Success Center website for additional information: https://www.cmu.edu/student- success/ .   5.2 LTI Academic Policies   5.2.1 “Grandfather” policy   A student can graduate under the policies in effect at the time that the student entered the  program; or, at the student's choice, the student can graduate under policies that are adopted after the student entered the program. If it is not realistic to follow a particular policy exactly, the department may approximate the policy as closely as possible; this situation is rare and typically arises only when a student is enrolled in the program for an extended period of time.   5.2.2 Definition of transfer credit  versus course exemption   The LTI may grant transfer credit or issue an exemption  for equivalent graduate courses  previously completed at another institution. This decision rests with the chair of the particular program. If a student is exempt  from a required course due to prior courses or experience, the  student can replace that course with an open elective. The student does not receive credit for the external course, but can take any course that could normally count toward the degree in its place. If a student receives c redit  for prior coursework completed at CMU or elsewhere, the  student receives that many units of credit, and the total amount of required coursework is  reduced by that amount.  MLT Graduate Student Handbook  Page 24   5.2.3 External Employment/Consulting   Students funded by LTI research projects are nor mally expected to work exclusively for those  projects. Since consulting may provide  useful experience, students are generally permitted to  consult, at most , one eight -hour day per seven -day week, only with the advisor's consent.  International students must also have approval in advance from the Office of International  Education (OIE); otherwise, they may be in violation of their visa status.   Important: Any work for pay outside of the funding research project must be approved in  advance by the advisor (and OIE, for international students).   This includes paid TAing,  consulting, online free -lancing, etc.   5.2.4 Leave of Absence   The LTI discourages Leaves of Absence (LOA), since students usually do not return, despite good intentions. However, a student in good standing may be granted a LOA of at most 1 year, upon written request to the Program Director and with consent of the student's advisor. It is the  responsibility of the student on LOA to contact the LTI to initiate a return to the program.   5.2.5 Satisfactory Progress   If a student does not make satisfactory progress each semester toward completing the degree,  the LTI may remove the student from the program.  See section on “End of Semester  Evaluation .”  5.2.6 Winter and Summer Breaks   Students supported by research projects are expected to remain on campus working during breaks in classes. A two -week vacation is ty pically allowed in the summer. The normal winter  break policy is that the student works 40 hours per week for two weeks, and takes vacation for the other two weeks.   5.3 CMU Academic Policies   5.3.1 Assistance for Individuals with Disabilities  http://www.cmu.edu/disability- resources    The Office of Disability Resources at Carnegie Mellon University has a continued mission to provide physical and programmatic campus access to all events and information within the Carnegie Mellon community.  We work to ensure that qualified individuals rec eive reasonable  accommodations as guaranteed by the Americans with Disabilitie s Act (ADA) and Section  504 of  the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.  Students who would like to receive accommodations can begin MLT Graduate Student Handbook  Page 25   the process through Disability Resources’ secure online portal  or email  access@andrew.cmu.edu  to begin the interactive accommodation proce ss.    Students with physical, sensory, cognitive, or emotional disabilities are encouraged to self - identify with the Office of Disability Resources and request needed accommodations. Any  questions about the process can be directed to access@andrew.cmu.edu  or call 412 -268- 6121.   5.3.2 Summary of Graduate Student Appeal and Grievance Procedures   https://www.cmu.edu/graduate/policies/appeal- grievance -procedures.html   Graduate students will find the Summary of Graduate Student Appeal and Grievance Procedures on the Graduate Education Resource webpage. This document summarizes   processes available to graduate students who seek review of academic and non- academic  issues. Generally, graduate students are expected to seek informal resolution of all concerns within the applicable department, unit, or program before invoking formal p rocesses. When an  informal resolution cannot be reached, however, a graduate student who seeks further review of the matter is to follow the for mal procedures outlined here. T hese appeal and grievance  procedures shall apply to students in all graduate programs of the University. Students should refer to the department specific information in this handbook for department and college  information about the administration and aca demic policies of the program.     5.3.3 Process for Appealing Final Grades   https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/theword/academic/appeal -of-grades -and academic - actions.html     Final grades will be changed only in exceptional circumstances and only with the approval of  the instructor and the department, unit, or program. Grading is a  matter of sound discretion of  the instructor, and final grades are rarely changed without the consent of the instructor who assigned the grade. The following circumstances are the unusual exceptions that may warrant a grade appeal:   a) The final grade assigned for a course is based on manifest error (e.g., a clear error such as arithmetic error in computing a grade or failure to grade one of the answers on an exam)   b) The faculty or staff member who assigned the grade did so in violation of  University policy.    MLT Graduate Student Handbook  Page 26   5.3.4 Safeguarding Educational Equity:   Sexual Misconduct Policy   The University prohibits sex -based discrimination, sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating/  domestic violence, and stalking.  The University also prohibits retaliation against individuals  who bring forward such concerns or allegations in good faith.  The University’s Sexual  Misconduct Policy is available at https://www.cmu.edu/policies/administrative -and- governance/sexual -misconduct/index.html .  The University’s Policy Against Retaliation is available  at https://www.cmu.edu/policies/administrative -and-governance/whistleblower.html .  If you have  been impacted by any of these issues, you are encouraged to  make contact with any of the  following resources:   •    Offic e of Title IX Initiatives,  https://www.cmu.edu/title-ix/    412- 268-7125, tix@cmu.edu   •    University Police, 412 -268-2323   Additional resources and information can be found at:  https://www.cmu.edu/title-ix/resources- and-information/resources.html .    5.3.5 Gestational and Parental  Accommodatio n  https://www.cmu.edu/graduate/programs- services/maternity -accommodation protocol.html      Providing holistic student support is a top priority at Carnegie Mellon. The protocols on this page are designed to support the parental needs of students and their families.   Students seeking any of the parental accommodations described below must register with the Office of the Dean of Students by contacting the office for an appointment by calling 412-268- 2075.   Students are encouraged to register with the Office of the Dean of Students ninety (90) days in advance of the anticipated arrival of the child as applicable in the individual circumstances. At  the time  of registration, students will have the opportunity to consult about resources,  procedures, funding options, and preparation for discussing academic accommodations with  the student’s academic department. Students should also consult with their academic advisors either before or in conjunction with registering with the Office of the Dean of Students.   Accommodations for Gestational Parents   The birth of a child is a significant life event that may require time away from academic pursuits for delivery and reco very from delivery of a newly born child. Students whose anticipated  delivery date is during the course of a semester  may need to take time away from their  academic responsibilities. Carnegie Mellon students seeking time away are afforded two  options as a possible accommodation:  MLT Graduate Student Handbook  Page 27   • Short -term accommodation for gestational parents  – A short -term absence  from academic responsibilities up to a maximum of six (6) weeks. Short term  accommodations may be extended by two (2) weeks for a total of eight (8) weeks, wher e a longer absence is medically necessary. Prior to the absence  students must work with relevant university faculty and staff to adjust their course work, research, teaching and other academic responsibilities during the period of absence. This may include  extensions of time to complete assignments,  incomplete grades, and/or dropping courses, shifting research  responsibilities  and adjusting TA assignments. Students who take a  short-t erm ac commodation  will remain enrolled.   • Formal Leave of Absence - A formal leave of absence under the Student Leave  Policy. Generally, the Student Leave Policy permits students to take a leave of absence for a full -semester, mini- semester, or for the time remaining in the  semester during which the leave is taken.  Students who take a Formal Leave of  Absence ( https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/student- leave.html) drop all remaining courses for the semester and are unenrolled for  the semester. International students must consult with the Office of International Education (https://www.cmu.edu/oie/) before considering this   option due to visa implications.   Financial Assistance for Student Parents   Carnegie Mellon also offers the following options for financial assistance to students who become parents while enrolled:   Interest- free Loan – Any student who becomes a parent is eligible to apply for an interest- free  parental loan ( https://www.cmu.edu/student- affairs/dean/loans/ ) from the Office of the Dean  of Students.   6 Financial Issues   6.1 Graduate Student Funding   For all LTI MLT students, full funding (tuition plus stipend) is guaranteed for the first year. This support is normally continued for the duration of the program, subject to continuing satisfactory progress and availability of funding. The fellowship includes full tuition and fees,  and a monthly MLT stipend. In addition, the LTI pays a dependency allowance of 10% of the  student's monthly stipend to any student with a child, unless they have a spouse who earns  more than $200 per month.   If an MLT student receives an outside graduate fellowship (e.g., NSF, Fulbright), the student is expected to accept it in place of the LTI’s graduate fellowship. As an extra incentive to do so,  the LTI will supplement the award so that the student will receive full tuition and a combined MLT Graduate Student Handbook  Page 28   stipend 10 percent higher than that of the standard LTI graduate fellowship. Students are  required to inform the LTI about any external funding that they receive.   6.2 University Financial Aid   Graduate students should consult the graduate student financial aid information found on The  HUB website: http://www.cmu.edu/finaid/graduate/index.html .  6.3 Conference Travel Funding   Students funded by a research project receive travel funding according to policies set by the  individual projects.  Students who have no project funding may be provided with partial funding,  with a larger amount available for travel to presen t a refereed conference paper. There is an LTI  form that must be filled out in advance.  6.4 Office of the Dean of Students Emergency Support Funding   Graduate students who find themselves in need of immediate funds for emergency situations should contact the Office of the Dean of Students (see Appendix A),  www.cmu.edu/student- affairs/index.html , to inquire about the types of emergency funding available to enrolled  students.  6.5 Health Insurance   Carnegie Mellon has a Student Health Insurance pol icy requiring full -time, degree -seeking  students to carry adequate medical insurance. Students must either purchase the plan offered  by the University , or an application for a waiver can be made if the student is “enrolled as the  dependent, partner/spouse or pr incipal in an employer or government -sponsored insurance  plan” (see the Carnegie Mellon University Student Health Insurance Policy at  http://www.cmu.edu/policies/documents/StudentInsurance ).   The LTI does not cover student health insurance, regardless of the students’ funding situation. It is the responsibility of each student to make arrangements with Student Health Services to either pay for their insurance at the beginning of the semester, or elect a payment plan over the course of the academic year. Mor e information is available at the Student Health Services  Web site www.studentaffairs.cmu.edu/HealthServices/insurance .      MLT Graduate Student Handbook  Page 29   6.6 Emergency Loans   http://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/index.html   All students , regardless of their program, are eligible for the Emergency Student Loan, which is   an interest- free and emergency- based loan repayable within 30 days. It is available through the  Office of the Dean of Student Affairs; students may apply for the loan by stopping in to the  Student Affairs Office, Warner Hall 301, or by calling (412) 268 -2075 for an appointment.   6.7 Employment Eligibility Verification   If you are receiving a stipend, are a TA, or are planning to have a positio n with CMU then  Employment Eligibility Verification is required. Form I -9 must be  completed within 3 business  days of beginning work for any type of compensation (stipend or employment). Additional  details are highlighted  below. To ensure compliance with federal law, Carnegie Mellon  University  maintains the Employment Eligibility Verification (I -9) Policy [pdf] covering  the  university’s I -9 and E -Verify requirements:   • Every individual receiving a stipend from CMU or employed by CMU   must comply with the I -9 Policy by completing the Form I -9 within three  business  days following the first day of stipend start date/employment.   • Individuals who expect to work on a federally funded project are further responsible for submitting an E -Verify Processin g Request Form to the Office of  Human Resources if required.   • For more information, please see CMU’s Guidance for Completing the Form I -9  and E -Verify Requirements at CMU [pdf], or visit the Human Resources Service  website to learn more about Form I -9 and E -Verify and to schedule an  appointment to complete the Form I -9.  • Students who fail to complete the Form I -9 in a timely manner may have stipend  payments suspended.   If employed by the university, an individual who fails to  timely complete the Form I -9 may be subject to  disciplinary action up to and  including termination of employment.   7 Additional University Resources   7.1 The HUB Student Services Center   thehub@andrew.cmu.edu and http://www.cmu.edu/hub/    The HUB is located in Warner Hall, Lower Level.

206	25 Great Things About SCS What’s so great about computer science at Carnegie Mellon? We're glad you asked! Here are 25 great ideas from CMU computer scientists to think about as we celebrate the birthday of the School of Computer Science. 1. Artificial intelligence, 1955-56 Can you write a working computer program without a computer? Herb Simon (H’90), at left, Allen Newell (IA’57), at right, and Cliff Shaw did. The team created the first artificial intelligence program, Logic Theorist, which could solve logic puzzles in the same way that a human might solve them. Newell demonstrated that it worked by writing the instructions on 3-by-5 index cards that were manipulated on the kitchen table by Newell, his wife, and a group of Carnegie Tech grad students.  2. Multi-core processors, 1971 Multi-core processors are common in today’s computers, but they were still science fiction in the early 1970s. But when CMU researchers found their existing machines too slow to keep pace with the advance of speech and graphics programs, they knew they had to do something. They solved the problem by ganging together 16 processors to build a pioneering computer called C.mmp—then topped the feat by linking 50 processors into Cm*.  3. Tutoring machines, 1973 Games and drills, such as flash cards, have long been used to help students learn tough subjects. But the cognitive tutoring programs developed at Carnegie Mellon, beginning in the 1970s, did more than simply drill students on math problems. Cognitive tutors were able to adapt, presenting harder or easier problems as students learned or stumbled. Today, cognitive tutors teach subjects such as algebra to hundreds of thousands of students every year.  4. Speech recognition, 1976 If you have an iPhone, ask Siri to look up “Hearsay I,” the first computer system capable of continuous speech recognition. It was developed by future Turing Award winner and future SCS dean Raj Reddy along with his students. Their work on subsequent systems established many of the principles that still underlie speech recognition software.  5. Emoticons, 1982 Sure, it was just a joke, but (for better or worse) it’s endured for more than three decades. CMU researcher Scott Fahlman created the emoticon to clear up misunderstandings on computer message boards. We’ve been looking at the world sideways ever since. :-)  6. Andrew project, 1982 It was long the dream of computer scientists to put a workstation in every home and office, but no one had actually tried to accomplish it until researchers from Carnegie Mellon University and IBM launched the Andrew Project. Soon, every student, faculty member and employee had access to email, word processing, file-transfer services and graphics programs, and CMU was the most-wired campus in the world.  7. Autonomous robots, 1983 Thanks to Red Whittaker (E'75,'79), robots moved off of the assembly lines and into places no human ever could go. His Robotic Reconnaissance Vehicle spent four years inspecting and cleaning up the contaminated reactor building at the crippled Three Mile Island nuclear plant.  8. User interfaces, 1983 Why should humans adapt to fit computers? Shouldn’t computers adapt to fit humans? That was the attitude of CMU researchers, who applied design principles to computer science to develop better, easier-to-use interfaces. They called the new field “human-computer interaction.”  9. Machine translation, 1984 Every “Star Trek” fan knows about the universal translator. Scientists in the Language Technologies Institute are moving those gadgets from science fiction to real life. Their pioneering systems include handheld, portable speech-to-speech translators, just like those depicted on the USS Enterprise.  10. Mach kernel, 1985 In computer parlance, a “kernel” is the heart of an operating system, passing input and output requests to and from the processor. At the core of all modern Apple devices --- including iPhones, iPads and MacBooks --- is the Mach kernel, developed at CMU under the leadership of then-professor Rick Rashid.  11. Computer chess, 1990 Could a computer play chess at the level of the world’s best players? For many years, it was considered the “holy grail” of artificial intelligence. Hitech, developed by CMU researcher Hans Berliner (CS’74), was the first computer to achieve grandmaster status. CMU alumni played key roles in developing “Deep Blue,” the IBM machine that beat human chess champion Garry Kasparov in 1997.  12. Java, 1991 As a CMU grad student, James Gosling (CS’83) worked on the Andrew project, which stressed interoperability between computers, whether they were Macs, IBMs or Unix machines. Those lessons served Gosling well when he developed Java, the first programming language able to run on almost any platform.  13. Email attachments, 1992 Steve Jobs liked the email system built into CMU’s Andrew so much that he tried to hire Nathaniel Borenstein (CS’81,’85) and the rest of his team to create a similar program for Apple. Borenstein didn’t take the offer, but he did like Jobs’ idea about attaching documents to email. Borenstein went on to develop the MIME standard that’s used by all email programs to send photos and other files over the Internet.  14. Web search engines, 1994 The World Wide Web was still in its toddler stage when CMU researcher Michael “Fuzzy” Mauldin (CS’83,’89) developed one of the first successful search engines, Lycos. It was the most-visited site on the Web by 1999.  15. Model checking, 1994 CMU professor Edmund Clarke had long stressed the importance of verifying computer hardware and software through a formal problem-solving technique called “model checking.” In 1994, his arguments gained new weight with the discovery that Intel’s amazing new Pentium chip made errors on certain math problems. Clarke would go on to receive the Turing Award for his role in the development of model checking.  16. CAPTCHAs, 2000 “Spam” and malicious attacks were a growing problem on the Internet when hackers developed automated “bots” that could sign up for email and other Web services without human intervention. Luis von Ahn (CS’03,’05), Nick Hopper (CS’04), John Langford (CS’02) and CMU professor Manuel Blum invented a “Completely Automated Public Turing Test to tell Computers and Humans Apart,” or CAPTCHA, to help foil the bots. A later variation, reCAPTCHA, is helping digitize old books and newspapers.  17. Robotic video cameras, 2001 When Baltimore Ravens quarterback Trent Dilfer dropped back to pass, TV viewers of Super Bowl XXXV saw something they’d never seen before --- the motion froze and the view suddenly rotated to show Dilfer’s opposite side. CBS called it Eyevision. The synchronized system of robotic cameras and advanced image processing was the brainchild of CMU’s Takeo Kanade, one of many advances he pioneered in computer vision.  18. Self-driving vehicles, 2007 Carnegie Mellon’s early attempts at self-driving vehicles progressed slowly, creeping around Pittsburgh’s Schenley Park in the late 1990s. But they were going full-throttle by the time CMU’s self-driving SUV, named BOSS, won the 2007 DARPA Urban Challenge road race.  19. Thought reading programs, 2007 Your brain reacts in different ways, depending on what words you’re thinking about --- ways that are measurable with magnetic-resonance imaging, or MRI, machines. CMU researchers Tom Mitchell and Marcel Just are decoding those brain scans and are making progress at reading people’s thoughts.  20. Kidney donor matching, 2008 Organ transplants save lives every day, but more people could likely be saved if it was easier to match recipients with donors who are unrelated. An algorithm developed by CMU scientists is close to enabling a nationwide network that would match living kidney donors with potential recipients whom they've never met in real life.  21. RNA sequencing via videogames, 2010 Thanks to crowdsourcing, science isn’t just for scientists any more. People without formal training in molecular biology are producing new insights into genetic encoding through a videogame called EteRNA, developed by researchers at CMU and Stanford, that allows players to fold and shift RNA molecules to solve on-screen puzzles.  22. Language learning software, 2010 Learning a second language has always been challenging, but a CMU spinoff called Duolingo is proving that it doesn’t have to be expensive. Duolingo has developed language tutoring software that enables users to learn Spanish, English, Italian, German, Portuguese or French for free through its website and mobile apps. In the process, Duolingo users are helping to translate the Web.  23. Question-answering computers, 2011 Searching the Web for information is rarely as simple as asking a question in plain English. So-called “question-answering” machines moved from laboratories to TV screens when an IBM computer called “Watson” defeated two human champions on the game show “Jeopardy!” At the heart of Watson was computer architecture developed by CMU’s Eric Nyberg and his students.  24. Encrypting online information, 2012 Credit card numbers and other data used online is safer thanks to an encryption scheme developed by CMU alumna Shafi Goldwasser (S’79). She shared the 2012 Turing Award for her role in developing practical encoding schemes that are difficult to break.  25. Smart, adaptable traffic signals, 2012 Smart traffic lights developed at CMU’s Robotics Institute are saving time and energy, and cutting down on the amount of air pollution created by idling cars. First rolled out in Pittsburgh’s East Liberty neighborhood, the new signals are being studied around the country.

  Welcome to the Language Technologies Institute. While this handbook (and your college  graduate student handbook) is specific to your academic experience in the LTI, there are  several other resources and offices that graduate students are encouraged to consult during  their tenure at Carnegie Mellon University. Information about The Word, the student  handbook, the Office of Graduate and Postdoc Affairs, the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs, and others, are included in Appendix A of this  handbook.   1.1 Vision   Carnegie Mellon University will have a transformative impact on society through continual   innovation in education, research, creativity, and entrepreneurship.   1.2 Mission   To create a transformative educational  experience for students focused on deep disciplinary   knowledge; problem solving; leadership, communication, and interpersonal skills; and personal  health and well -being.    To cultivate a transformative university  community committed to (a) attracting and retaining   diverse, world -class talent; (b) creating a collaborative environment open to the free exchange  of ideas, where research, creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship can flourish; and (c)  ensuring  individuals can achieve their full potential.     To impact society in a transformative way  — regionally, nationally, and globally —  by engaging   with partners outside the traditional borders of the university campus.   1.3 The MIIS Degree   The Master of Science in Intelligent Information Systems (MIIS) is a professional degree  offered by the Language Technologies Institute (LTI), a graduate department in the School of  Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University.  The MIIS degree provides advanced study  and practical experience in areas of Computer Science focused on the processing and analysis  of unstructured and semi -structured information, for example, text, image, video, speech, and  audio information. It is a practice -oriented professional degree designed for students who  want to rapidly master advanced content -analysis, mining, and intelligent information  technologies prior to beginning or resuming leadership careers in industry and government.   There are significant differences between CMU's different departments and degree programs  in philosophical approach, procedures, policies,  and regulations. Each department issues a MIIS Graduate Student Handbook  Page 7   handbook that informs graduate students of their program requirements and procedures and  ensures that students have written access to the standard information outlined below. This  handbook describes the policies, procedures, and requirements for the Master  of Science in  Intelligent Information Systems (MIIS) degree.

MIIS Graduate Student Handbook  Page 9   1.6 The Carnegie Mellon Code   Students at Carnegie Mellon, because they are members of an academic community dedicated  to the achievement of excellence, are expected to meet the highest standards of personal,  ethical,  and moral conduct possible.    These standards require personal integrity, a commitment to honesty without compromise, as well as truth without equivocation and a willingness to place the good of the community  above the good of the self. Obligations once undertaken must be met, commitments kept.    As members of the Carnegie Mellon community, individuals are expected to uphold the  standards of the community in addition to holding others accountable for said standards. It is  rare that the life of a student in an academic community can be so private that it will not affect  the community as a whole or that the above standards do not apply.    The discovery, advancement and communication of knowledge are not possible without a commitment to these standards. Creativity cannot exist without acknowledgment of the  creativity of others. New knowledge cannot be developed without credit for prior knowl edge.  Without the ability to trust that these principles will be observed, an academic community  cannot exist.   The commitment of its faculty, staff and students to these standards contributes to the high respect in which the Carnegie Mellon degree is held. Students must not destroy that respect  by their failure to meet these standards. Students who cannot meet them  should voluntarily  withdraw from the university.   The Carnegie Mellon Code can also be found on -line at https://www.cmu. edu /student- affairs/theword/.   1.7 University Policies and Expectations   It is the responsibility of each member of the Carnegie Mellon community to be familiar with  university policies and guidelines.

The LTI  cluster provides storage and computation for projects involving large datas ets and/or lengthy  computation.    3 CMU Degree Completion and Certification   3.1 Standard Degree Requirements & Degree Certification   Carnegie Mellon graduate students are expected to complete their degree requirements within the standard length of time for their program of study as outlined in the relevant Graduate  Student Handbook. Standard program lengths for graduate students vary significantly ranging  from two semesters for some full- time master’s programs to several or more years for doctoral  programs. Upon completion of the graduate program degree requirements, the degree will be  certified by the student’s academic program in the s emester in which the student completes  the requirements.   Early  Completion   Graduate students who consider the completion of all degree requirements in less than the standard length of time for their program of study may consult with their degree -granting  program or department to determine if early degree certification is allowed and under what circumstances .   Extended or Longer- than- Standard Comp letion   Longer- than -standard degree completion may occur due to academic interruptions in making  progress toward the degree as defined by the academic program, interruptions of full -time study  or progress towards the degree due to serious, documented medical issues, or other unusual or unforeseen circumstances.    Master’s students who require longer than the standard time to complete their degree  requirements are expected to remain in close contact with their graduate program, and will be  certified at the end of the semester in which they have completed their degree requirements.  Students shall reference CMU Policy on Master’s Student Statute of Limitations :  www.cmu.edu/policies/student -and- student- life/masters -students -statute -of limitations.html  regarding guidelines and restrictions which place an upper limit on t he maximum length of  time allowable for master’s degree completion and certification.    MIIS Graduate Student Handbook  Page 12    3.2 Statute of Limitations   As outlined in the Master’s Students Statute of Limitations,  https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student- and-student- life/masters -students- statute -of- limitations.html students will complete all requirements for the master’s degree within a  maximum of seven years from original matriculation as a master’s student, or less if required  by a more restrictive department, school or college policy. Once this time -to-degree lim it has  lapsed, the person may resume work towards a master’s degree only if newly admitted to a currently offered master’s degree program under criteria determined by that program.   Under extraordinary circumstances, such as leave of absence, military or public service, family  or parental leave, or temporary disability, a school or college may, upon the relevant  department's recommendation and with the written approval of the dean (or  designate), defer  the lapse for a period commensurate with the duration of that interruption. Students who are  pursuing a master’s degree as part- time students for all semesters of their program, as  approved by their program, may also appeal to their program or department for extension of  the time to degree limit.   3.3 Additional Guidance for Students   Program of Study   Students seeking guidance about their program of study and degree requirements should consult with their academic advisor and/or appropriate associate dean.    Financial Aid and Student Account   Students are expected to make normal progress toward their degree in order to graduate within the standard timeframe for their program of study. Under U.S. Federal Title IV regulations,  student eligibility for federal financial aid is contingent upon enrol lment in and successful  completion of courses that are counted as credit toward their current degree program. To receive the maximum amount of federal financial aid for which they may be eligible, students  must enroll each semester in at least 36 units that count toward their current degree level. (See  separate guidance regarding integrated degree completion.) Students should consult with their  designated college liaison in The HUB regarding billing and financial aid, particularly for early completion, long er-than standard completion, or integrated undergraduate and master’s degree  programs.     International Students   Immigration status for students in F -1 and J -1 nonimmigrant status is tied to making normal  progress toward completing degree requirements. Therefore, F -1 and J -1 students who are  considering completing their degree requirements early, anticipating longer -than -standard  completion, or moving from an undergraduate to a graduate student classification (integrated undergraduate -graduate study) should consult with their designated advisor in the Office of  International Education (OIE) to ensure compliance with immigration regulations.  MIIS Graduate Student Handbook  Page 13    4 MIIS Degree Requirements and Related Policies/Protocols   4.1 Program Options   The MIIS degree is offered in  two options:   Option 1.  Standard MIIS degree  (MIIS -16) - A 16 -month track that is completed in three  academic semesters (fall, spring, fall) and a summer internship.   Option 2.  MIIS: Advanced Study degree  (MIIS -21) - A 21 -month track that is completed in  four academic semesters (fall, spring, fall, spring) and a summer internship.   MIIS: Advanced Study track offers in depth  degree in one of the following areas of  concentration:   • Human Language for Language Technologies   • Language Technology Application   • Machine Learning for Language Technologies   Part- time options are available in some cases.   4.2 Required Units for Degree Attainment   To complete the Master of Science in Intelligent Information Systems, a student must satisfy  three types of requirements. Curricular requirements ensure that MIIS students receive  instruction in core intelligent information systems technologies while also allowing an  opportunity to specialize in areas of personal interest.  Practice requirements are opportunities  to apply and hone new skills while building state -of-the-art systems. Grade  requirements ensure  that students have demonstrated a certain level of sk ill while completing degree requirements.  All three types of requirements are described below.   MIIS -16 students must take at least 84 units (typically 7 12 -unit courses) of qualifying and  elective courses that satisfy human language, machine learning, and language technology  applications breadth requirements and 66 practice units for a total of 150 units to attain the  Standard MIIS degree.   MIIS -21 students must take at least 108 units (typically 9 12 -unit courses) of qualifying and  elective courses and 66 practice units to satisfy their degree requirements, making it a total of 174 units to attain the MIIS: Advanced Study degree.  4.3 Core Requirements  MIIS Graduate Student Handbook  Page 14    A MIIS  student must complete the following curricular requirements:   1. Qualifying courses:    MIIS -16 students must pass 72 units (typically 6 12 -unit courses) and MIIS -21 students  must complete 96 units (typically 8 12 -unit courses) in qualifying master’s  courses.   A qualifying master’s  course is defined as:   a. Any graduate course (600 -level or higher) offered by the Language Technologies  Institute; and   b. Any graduate course (600 -level or higher) from the  list of approved qualifying  courses  (Section 3. 2.4).  2. Free elective:  Students must pass 12 units (typically 1 course) in elective master’s   course(s). A free elective is defined as:   a. A graduate course (600 -level or higher)  with content relevant to the MIIS  program objectives offered  by the School of Computer Science ; and   b. A course approved by the student's advisor and the degree Program Director.   c. A student may not use the same course to satisfy both a qualifying course  requirement and an elective course requirement.   3. Breadth requirements : Students must demonstrate breadth by passing one  course in  each of the following areas. In addition, MIIS -21 students must take two more LTI  courses (24 units total) in one of the following areas of concentration:   • Human language;   • Machine learning; and   • Language technology applications.    The department maintains and publishes a list of courses  that satisfy each of these  requirements (Sections 3. 2.5 – 3.2.7). Some c ourses  used to satisfy a breadth requirement  can also satisfy qualifying course requirements.  A student should get approval from the  director for the breadth courses , if not listed below.   4.4 Approved Qualifying Courses   Any graduate course  (600 -level or higher) offered by the Language Technologies Institute is  a qualifying course.   Any two graduate courses (600 -level or higher) offered by departments within the SCS   relevant to the MIIS degree other than LTI (Machine Learning or Computer Science departments, etc.) may be counted as approved qualifying courses .  MIIS Graduate Student Handbook  Page 15    Any course from the following list is an approved qualifying course.  • 02-712, Computational Methods for Biological Modeling and Simulation   • 05-631, Software Structures for User interfaces   • 05-813, Human Factors   • 10-708, Probabilistic Graphical Models   • 16-720, Computer Vision   • 17-631 Information Security, Privacy & Policy   • 17-781, Mobile and IoT Computing Services    4.4.1 Breadth Courses:  Human Language   • 11-611, Natural Language Processing   • 11-624, Human Language for Artificial Intelligence   • 11-711, Advanced NLP   • 11-722, Grammar Formalisms   • 11-724, Human Language for Artificial Intelligence   • 11-727, Computational Semantics for NLP   • 11-737, Multilingual NLP   4.4.2 Breadth Courses:  Language Technology Applications   • 11-642, Search Engines   • 11-688, Concepts in Digital Multimedia and Cyber Forensics   • 11-692, Speech Processing   • 11-697.

Directed study requirement:  Students must pass 24 units (typically 12 units x 2  semesters) in directed study under the supervision of their advisor. Directed study is a  structured, task -oriented form of independent study that provides deep, hands -on  experience in a particular technology area and an opportunity to work closely with a  member of the faculty.   2. Internship requirement:  Students must complete a one -semester (typically summer)  internship at an organization (typically a company or government agency) approved by  the MIIS Program Director. Internships are an opportunity to apply new skills in a  professional setting and to le arn about software development in a ‘real world’  organization. Students with prior professional experience may petition the MIIS Program Director to waive this requirement.   MIIS students that do an internship during the summer semester are required to present their internship at a poster session at the beginning of the following Fall semester.  The poster and the student’s participation in the poster session are part of the internship  requirement.  Participation is required unless waived in writing by the MIIS Program  Director.   3. Capstone requirements:  Students must complete a capstone project (36 units) and a  capstone planning seminar (6 units). The capstone requirement gives students  experience with collaborative, team -oriented software development; significant hands - on experience with the techniques studied in the classroom; and an opportunity to work on a large software application.   a. The capstone project (36 units) is a large, group- oriented demonstration of  student skill in one or more areas covered by the degree. Typically,  the result of  the capstone project is a major software application. The capstone project is  supervised by a member of the faculty who meets with students on a weekly  basis to monitor progress and provide guidance.  MIIS Graduate Student Handbook  Page 17    b. The capstone planning seminar (6 units) organizes students into groups; defines  capstone project goals, requirements, success metrics, and deliverables; and  identifies and acquires data, software, and other resources required for successful  completion of the project. The planning seminar must be completed in the semester prior to taking the capstone project.   4.6 Registration Process/Procedures   Students are responsible for registering for their courses. Use the Stellic Degree Audit  Application  to  monitor your progress and plan your degree. Students  can search for relevant  courses in a number of ways and share your plan with your advisor directly through the  application.    Navigate to the  SIO Academic Info tab and select Enrollment Status and the upcoming  semester to confirm the following:   • Enrollment Status is 'Eligible to Enroll' (if not, email  thehub@andrew.cmu.edu )  • Maximum units for which you can plan to register for (overloads are reviewed and  permitted  only after  registration week)   • Class Level, College and Department are correct (if incorrect, please contact your home  academic department)     The registration process can be completed within SIO (Student Information Online) by following 4 easy steps: https://www.cmu.edu/hub/registrar/docs/4 -easy -steps.pdf   If students have any questions about course selection, students  may reach out to MIIS program  director, Teruko Mitamura.   4.7 Drop/Add/Withdraw Procedures   Students taking undergraduate and master’s level courses must follow the procedures and  deadlines for adding, dropping, or withdrawing from courses as identified on the academic  calendar. Information can be found at https://www.cmu.edu/hub/registrar/course - changes/index.html . P lease note that there is a separate calendar for doctoral courses that does  not apply to Masters’ students.   4.8 Transfer Courses and Pittsburgh Council on Higher Education (PCHE)  MIIS Graduate Student Handbook  Page 18    Carnegie Mellon University offers students the opportunity to take courses for credit through  a cross -registration program (see Pittsburgh Council on Higher Education (PCHE) and Cross - registration below) and through the receipt of transfer credit from other accredited institutions. The Carnegie Mellon University transcript will include info rmation on such  courses as follows: Carnegie Mellon courses and courses taken through the university's cross - registration program will have grades recorded on the transcript and be factored into the QPA. All other courses will be recorded on this transcript indicating where the course was taken,  but without grades. Such courses will not be considered for academic actions, honors or QPA  calculations.   https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student- and-student- life/transfer -credit -evaluation -and- assignment.html     NOTE: Suspended students may take courses elsewhere; however, they may receive transfer  credit only if their college’s and department's policies allow this.   4.9 Internships   If the experience will have units attached to it, the program should have deliverables from the  student commensurate with the number of units they are taking. This can be in the form of  interim and final reports on the experience, presentations in the foll owing semester regarding  the experience, assessments of their experience as it relates to their course of study, etc. Students are responsible for identifying and applying for internships on their own.  The LTI and the university provide several types of support for students seeking internships.    An annual poster session helps spread information from MIIS students that recently completed internships to MIIS students that will soon seek internships; other LTI professional master’s programs have similar internship- oriented poster sessions that MIIS s tudents may attend. The  university offers resume -writing and interviewing workshops to help prepare students and fall  and spring employment fairs to help students connect with companies.  The university’s Career  & Professional Development Center  https://www.cmu.edu/career/  provides other services as  well.   If a student cannot find an internship, the MIIS program will arrange an on -campus internship  with a university -based project.  This internship may be unpaid.   International students are required to consult with Office of International  Education for  eligibility before seeking an internship/co- op or signing an offer contract (required addition to  ensure the university is in compliance with immigration laws for F &  J status students) .  4.10 Advising  MIIS Graduate Student Handbook  Page 19    Each student has a faculty advisor charged with guiding the education and monitoring the  progress of the student through the program. The advisor also supervises the student's directed  study projects. This personal student -advisor relationship ensures that  every student receives  the necessary faculty mentoring. The advisor also provides the student with career advice.   How and when the advisor is selected:  Advisors are selected during the first month of the  program. Students are expected to attend the LTI Orientation Faculty Research Talks in which faculty describe their interests and areas of expertise, and to be proactive about meeting  individually with potential advisors. Typically, if a student and faculty member agree to enter  an advising relationship, it is approved by the Program Director. If a student has not found an  advisor after one month in the program, the Pr ogram Director will assign an advisor to the  student.   How to change advisors:  The initial advisor selection should be made carefully. However, it is  possible to change advisors. To do so, the student should find another faculty member willing to serve as an advisor, and then make a request to the Program Director to switch advisors . The  LTI follows the long -standing SCS policy that both the new and old advisors need to agree to  the change; typically, this is not a problem, assuming the new advisor has agreed in advance, as  described here. It is to the student' s advantage to avoid switching advisors, especially late in  their graduate studies, because forging a strong student- advisor relationship takes time.   4.11 LTI Orientation   Prior to the beginning of each Fall semester the LTI provides lectures and faculty research  talks to help students learn about the work done by CMU faculty and to provide an  opportunity for advisors to recruit new students.  Students are expected to attend  them and to  treat them as seriously as a course, because they provide a good introduction to the broad range of research done at the LTI.  Students do not have to register for the LTI Orientation  Faculty Research Talks, nor do they receive a grade, however the department is serious about its expectation that new students will attend these talks.   The LTI Orientation Canvas course  is a mandatory course designed to increase incoming LTI  graduate students' awareness and understanding of CMU's community standards and the  resources that CMU offers the students. The course includes several administrative tasks,  training, and educational  sessions. The students will be enrolled into the course by the  program administrator in early August. All MIIS students are expected to complete all  assignments by the end of their first semester in the program. Each assignment has its own due  date.   4.12 Summary of Graduate Student Appeal and Grievance Procedures   Graduate students will find the Summary of Graduate Student Appeal and Grievance  Procedures on the Graduate Education Resource webpage. This document summarizes MIIS Graduate Student Handbook  Page 20    processes available to graduate students who seek review of academic and non -academic issues.  Generally, graduate students are expected to seek informal resolution of all concerns within the  applicable department, unit, or program before invoking formal processes. When an informal  resolution cannot be reached, however, a graduate student who seeks further review of the matter is to follow the formal procedures outlined here. These appeal and grievance procedures  shall apply to students in all graduate progr ams of the University. Students should refer to the  department specific information in this handbook for department and college information about  the administration and academic policies of the program.   Summary of Graduate Student Appeal and Grievance Procedures - Office of Graduate and  Postdoctoral Affairs - Carnegie Mellon University (cmu.edu)   4.13 Intellectual Property Policy   The MIIS degree program adheres to Carnegie Mellon University policy on intellectual  property:  http://www.cmu.edu/policies/documents/IntellProp.html   5 Grad ing and Evaluation   5.1 Grading Scale/System   Students must demonstrate their mastery of material taught in courses and their success in applying their skills in directed study and capstone projects by satisfying the following grade requirements:   1. Minimum grade:    A student must obtain a B - or better grade in all courses, which count  towards core requirements. If a student receives a C or better, that course may count as an elective towards the degree requirements .  2. Minimum QPA :  A student must maintain an average QPA of at least 3.0 in courses and  projects used to satisfy degree requirements.   3. Pass/fail:   Pass/fail grades are not permitted for courses and projects used to satisfy a degree  requirement. Graduate students who are required to take additional undergraduate courses to build up the core foundations of computer science may not elect the pass/fail  option for these  courses.   5.2 Pass/Fail Grades   Pass/fail grades are not permitted for courses used to satisfy a degree requirement, except for  the 11 -696 (A) Capstone Planning Seminar and 11 -935 (R) LTI Practicum that are a Pass/Fail. MIIS Graduate Student Handbook  Page 21    Graduate students who are required to take additional undergraduate courses to build up the  core foundations of computer science may not elect the pass/fail option for these courses.   5.3 Independent Study   An independent study can be counted as an Elective course, but it cannot be counted as a Qualifying course.   5.4 University Policy on Grades   This policy offers details concerning university grading principles for students taking courses and covers the specifics of assigning and changing grades, grading options, drop/withdrawals, and course repeats.   It also defines the undergraduate and graduat e grading standards.   https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student- and-student-life/grading.html   5.5 Process for Appealing Final Grades   Final grades will be changed only in exceptional circumstances and only with the approval of the instructor and the department, unit or program. Grading is a matter of sound discretion of  the instructor and final grades are rarely changed without the consent of the instructor who  assigned the grade. The following circumstances are the unusual exceptions that may warrant a grade appeal: (a) the final grade assigned for a course is based on manifest error ( e.g., a clear  error such as arithmetic error in computing a grade or failure to grade one of the answers on an exam), or (b) the faculty or staff member who assigned the grade did so in violation of a  university  policy.   Summary of Graduate Student Appeal and Grievance Procedures - Office of Graduate and  Postdoctoral Affairs - Carnegie Mellon University (cmu.edu)   5.6 Policy on Grades for Transfer Courses   Carnegie Mellon University offers students the opportunity to take courses for credit through  a cross -registration program (see Pittsburgh Council on Higher Education (PCHE) and Cross - registration below) and through the receipt of transfer credit from other accredited institutions. The Carnegie Mellon University transcript will include information on such  courses as follows: Carnegie Mellon courses and courses taken through the university's cross - registration program will have grades recorded on the transcript and be factored into the QPA. All other courses will be recorded on this transcript indicating where the course was taken, but without grade. Such courses will not be taken into account for academic actions, honors or MIIS Graduate Student Handbook  Page 22    QPA calculations. (Note: Suspended students may take courses elsewhere; however, they may  receive transfer credit only if their college’s and department's policies allow this.)   https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student -and-student- life/transfer -credit- evaluation -and- assignment.html   5.7 End of Semester Evaluation   Near the end of each semester, the student must prepare a statement that describes their achievements in the current semester and plans for the next semester. At the end of the  semester, the faculty evaluates each student's academic progress. The student's advisor serves  as the student's advocate in this process. The result of the evaluation is a letter from the faculty to the student that indicates whether the student is making satisfactory progress towards  completing the degree.   A good letter  typically indicates that the student is making satisfactory progress. If the student  is doing exceptionally good work, a stronger adjective such as excellent  might be used, but this  is unusual.   If a student seems to be having trouble, the faculty determines whether it believes that the student can finish the degree, and if so, what needs to be accomplished to get back on track. This type of letter should be considered a serious warning. It is not  a permanent "black mark"  on the student's record; if the student begins making satisfactory progress again, there is no official record of the letter in the student's transcript.   In the most serious cases, the faculty gives the student an N- 1 letter that specifies a list of  conditions that the student must satisfy by specific deadlines. Failure to meet all  the specified  conditions may result in the student's termination from the program.   5.8 Satisfactory Progress   If a student does not make satisfactory progress each semester toward completing the degree,  the LTI may remove the student from the program or strongly encourage the student to consider switching to the four- semester program (MIIS -21) to complete all the requirements.   5.9 Academic Integrity   Please review the University Policy on Academic Integrity https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student- and-student- life/academic -integrity.html. The policy  includes the University expectations around academic integrity and provides definitions of  cheating, plagiarism, and unauthorized assistance.    MIIS Graduate Student Handbook  Page 23    A review of the University’s Academic Disciplinary Actions procedures   https://www.cmu.edu/student -affairs/theword/academic- discipline/index.html  is also  recommended. These procedures outline the process for investigating, reporting, and  adjudicating violations of the University Policy on Academic Integrity. The procedures also outline the appeal process.     In the midst of self -exploration, the high demands of a challenging academic environment can  create situations where some students have difficulty exercising good judgment. Academic  challenges can provide many opportunities for high standards to evolve if students actively  reflect on these challenges and if the community supports discussions to aid in this process. It  is the responsibility of the entire community to establish and maintain the integrity of our  university.   Carnegie Mellon University educates its students to become professionals who will serve  society with integrity. The university also creates and disseminates new knowledge and  expressions of knowledge in ways that benefit society. Carnegie Mellon strives to serve the  changing needs of society through the three primary goals outlined in its mission statement: to  create and disseminate knowledge and art through research and artistic expression, teaching  and learning and transfer to society, to serve students by teaching them leadership and  problem -solving skills, and the values of quality, ethical behavior, responsibility to society and  commitments to work, to pursue the advantages provided by a diverse community, open to the  exchange of ideas, where discovery and artistic creativity can flourish.   In any presentation, creative, artistic or research, it is the ethical responsibility of each student to identify the conceptual sources of the work submitted. Failure to do so is dishonest and is  the basis for a charge of cheating or plagiarism, which is subject to disciplinary action.     The university has a very clear and specific protocol for responding to alleged violations of  academic integrity.  Carnegie Mellon's Academic Disciplinary Actions Overview for Graduate  Students describes procedures for disciplinary actions against graduate students in cases of alleged violations of academic regulations and the appeal process.    Important note:   The LTI implements the above policy’s option of “conven[ing] a disciplinary  hearing according to the procedures of the department/program”.  Our procedure is as follows: a first violation is grounds for dismissal from the graduate program.  If we decide to not  immediately dismiss, the first violation will result in the student being on disciplinary probation.  If a student commits a second violation while on probation, the penalty is dismissal from the graduate program.   6 Academic Policies   6.1 MIIS Academic Policies  MIIS Graduate Student Handbook  Page 24    6.1.1 Double  Counting Courses   A Masters student who uses courses taken as part of another degree program (at Carnegie  Mellon or elsewhere) toward their program requirements cannot use those same courses  toward any other M.S. degree offered by the School of Computer Science without prior approval. (SCS policy)   6.1.2 Duration of Study   MIIS -16 students enrolled for full- time study are expected to complete the degree in three  semesters of academic study and one summer internship (16 months  total).   MIIS -21 students  enrolled for full- time study are expected to complete the degree in four  semesters of academic study and one summer internship (21 months total).   MIIS -16 students enrolled for part -time study are expected to complete the program in six  semesters of academic stu dy and  one summer internship (27  months  total ).    MIIS -21 students enrolled for part -time study are expected to complete the program in seven  semesters of academic study and one summer internship (31 months total).   See also the ‘Statute of Limitations’ policy.   6.1.3 Deferral   MIIS students are given the opportunity to defer their enrollment. The deferral request must be approved by the program director. The deferral can only be used once for the period of one academic year.   6.1.4 Maximum and Minimum Course  Loads   A student in the program may not take  more than sixty (60 ) units per  semester without  permission from the program director.   A student in the program must be registered for a minimum  thirty -six (36) units per semester  to be considered a full- time  student or twelve (12) units per semester to be considered a part- time  student. All international students are required by US Federal law to maintain full -time  status. Reduced Course Load is not permitted  for MIIS students. Failure to maintain full -time  status will result in loss of a student visa (and, therefore, “permit of stay”).  (MIIS policy)   6.1.5 Transfer Credit   An equivalent graduate course previously completed at  Carnegie Mellon,  or another  institution may be permitted to satisfy one of the MIIS breadth  requirements. The decision on  whether a course may be used to satisfy a breadth requirement is made by the MIIS Program MIIS Graduate Student Handbook  Page 25    Director. Typically , the student will provide the Program Director with the syllabus of the  external course, and the Program Director will use that and the student’s transcript to make  the decision.   Satisfying a breadth requirement with a course from another institution does not reduce the number of CMU course units that must be taken to attain the MIIS degree.   See the section on “Definition of transfer credit versus course exemption”  on page 2 5.  6.1.6 Transferring into the MIIS Program   Transfers into the MIIS program are not permitted during a student’s first semester at CMU.  Students must begin their study at CMU in the program that admitted them.  Students may request to transfer into the MIIS program after completing their first semester  and before the add/drop deadline of the spring semester.  The student must make the request  in writing (or email) to the MIIS Program Director.  The MIIS Program D irector will inform  the student about what application materials are required, for example, an explanation of why  a transfer is desired, a proposed plan of study, a proposed advisor, and CMU transcripts.   Students that are already enrolled in an LTI degree  program are not required to retake GRE  and TOEFL /IELTS/Duolingo  exams or to produce new transcripts from other universities.    The MIIS program will conduct an expedited admissions process after receiving such a request.  The program will explicitly consider whether the coursework done prior to the  transfer will allow the student to be “on schedule” by the end of the spring semest er, so that  the student can participate in a capstone project with other MIIS students during the next fall semester.   MIIS students are allowed to switch tracks (MIIS -16 to MIIS -21 and vice versa) after  beginning their first semester at CMU. Ideally, all switch requests must be filed  within the  first semester of the program. It is highly recommended to not switch tracks more than  once!  Though not forbidden, multiple track switching may negatively impact immigration  records of international  students. Students also must  understand that extension  of their stay  in the program will lead to additional financial obligations.    U.S. citizens, virtually, have no restrictions on how many times they can switch if  it is done for  a legitimate  reason. To confirm legitimacy of the reason to switch tracks  ALL  students must  seek their advisor's approval and the approval of the Director of the MIIS program.   6.1.7 Transferring Out of the MIIS Program   The MIIS program does not prevent students from transferring to another degree program.  Each degree program has its own rules about whether and when transfers into the program are  permitted.  A student that is interested in transferring out of the MIIS de gree program should  consult the handbook and Program Director of the desired degree program to learn whether  transfers are permitted, and if so, how,  and when to request such a transfer.  MIIS Graduate Student Handbook  Page 26    6.2 LTI Academic Policies   6.2.1 Verification  of Enrollment   Enrollment Services is the only University office that can provide an official letter of  enrollment, official transcript, and enrollment verification.  Enrollment verification can be  requested online through The HUB at https://www.cmu.edu/hub/registrar/student- records/verifications/enrollment.html.  6.2.2 “Grandfather” poli cy  A student can graduate under the policies in effect at the time that the student entered the  program; or, at the student's choice, the student can graduate under policies that are adopted  after the student entered the program. If it is not realistic to fol low a particular policy exactly,  the department may approximate the policy as closely as possible; this situation is rare and  typically arises only when a student is enrolled in the program for an extended period .  6.2.3 Time Away from Academic Responsibilities   Graduate students should not assume that their time -off follows the academic calendar of  courses. Many are coming from an undergraduate environment where their university  employment followed their course schedule. For many graduate degree programs, there i s an  expectation that graduate students continue research during academic breaks and time away  from campus which may or may not be negotiated with the students. If there are requirements  for student time beyond a typical week day, this should be specified.  Clarify that University  Holidays are also student holidays, and students need to consult their faculty about coverage if they have challenges with taking time off during University Holidays. For example, if  experiments are running that need to be monitored continuously students should speak with  their faculty about arrangements to take an equal number of days off at another time.   6.2.4 Definition of transfer credit versus course exemption   The LTI may grant transfer credit  or issue an exemption  for equivalent graduate courses  previously completed at another institution. This decision rests with the director  of the  program . If a student is exempt  from a required course due to prior courses or experience, the  student can replace that course with an open elective. The student does not receive credit for  the external course but  can take any course that could normally count toward the degree in its  place. If a student receives credit  for prior cou rsework completed at CMU or elsewhere, the  student receives that many units of credit, and the total amount of required coursework is reduced by that amount.  MIIS Graduate Student Handbook  Page 27    6.2.5 External Employment/Consulting   Since the M IIS program places heavy demands on student time, external employment and/or  consulting are strongly discouraged. Exceptional students who wish to consult should discuss  this with their Advisor. International students must also have approval in advance from the  Office of International Education (OIE) for any outside employment.   6.2.6 Leave of Absence   The LTI discourages Leaves of Absence (LOA), since students usually do not return, despite  good intentions. However, a student in good standing may be granted a LOA of at most 1 year, upon written request to the Program Director and with consent of the student's advisor. It is the responsibility of the student on LOA to contact the LTI to initiate a return to the program.   6.2.7 Withdrawal of a Degree   The University reserves the right to withdraw a degree even though it has been granted should there be discovery that the work upon which it was based or the academic records in support  of it had been falsified. In such a case, withdrawal of the degree will occur promptly upon  discovery of the falsification. The complete reference to this University policy is available at https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student -and-student- life/withdrawal- of-a-degree.html .  6.2.8 Winter and Summer Breaks   Students supported by research projects are expected to remain on campus working during  breaks in classes.  A two- week vacation is typically allowed in the summer.  The normal  winter break policy is that the student works 40 hours per week for two weeks and  takes  vacation for the other two weeks.   7 Safeguarding Educational Equity   7.1 Assistance for Individuals with Disabilities   http://www.cmu.edu/education- office/disability -resources/   The Office of Disability Resources at Carnegie Mellon University has a continued mission  to provide physical, digital, and programmatic access to ensure that students with disabilities have equal access to their educational experience. We work to ensure that  qualified individuals receive reasonable accommodations as guaranteed by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Students  who would like to receive accommodations can begin the process through Disability MIIS Graduate Student Handbook  Page 28    Resources' secure online portal ( https://rainier.accessiblelearning.com/cmu/ ) or email  access@andrew.cmu.edu  to begin the interactive accommodation process.   Students with physical, sensory, cognitive, or emotional disabilities are encouraged to self - identify with the Office of Disability Resources and request needed accommodations. Any  questions about the process can be directed to access@andrew.cmu.edu , or call (412) 268 - 6121.  7.2 Sexual Misconduct Policy   The University prohibits sex -based discrimination, sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating/  domestic violence,  and stalking.  The University also prohibits retaliation against individuals  who bring forward such concerns or allegations in good faith.     The University’s Sexual Misconduct Policy is available at   https://www.cmu.edu/policies/administrative -and-governance/sexual-misconduct/index.html .    The University’s Policy Against Retaliation is available at    https://www.cmu.edu/policies/administrative -and-governance/whistleblower.html .   If you have been impacted by any of these issues, you are encouraged to make contact with  any of the following resources:    Office of Title IX Initiatives    o  https://www.cmu.edu/title -ix/, 412-268-712 5, tix@cmu.edu    University Police   o https:// www.cmu.edu/police/, 412-268-2323   Additional resources and information can be found at :   https://www.cmu.edu/title -ix/resources -and-information/resources.html .  7.3 Gestational and Parental Accommodations   https://www.cmu.edu/graduate/programs- services/maternity -accommodation-protocol.html   Providing holistic student support is a top priority at Carnegie Mellon. The protocols on this  page are designed to support the parental needs of students and their families.   Students seeking any of the Parental Accommodations described below must register with the Office of the Dean of Students by contacting the office for an appointment by calling  412-268-2075.  MIIS Graduate Student Handbook  Page 29    Students are encouraged to register with the Office of the Dean of Students ninety (90) days in  advance of the anticipated arrival of the child as applicable in the individual circumstance.   At  the time of registering, students will have the opportunity to consult about resources, procedures, funding options and preparation for discussing academic accommodations with the student’s academic department.   Students should also consult with their academic advisors  either before or in conjunction with registering with the Off ice of the Dean of Students.   Accommodations for Gestational Parents   The birth of a child is a significant life event that may require time away from  academic pursuits  for delivery and recovery from delivery of a newly born  child. Students whose anticipated  delivery date is during the course of a semester may need to take time away from their academic responsibilities.  Carnegie Mellon students seeking time away are afforded two options as   possible accommodation:   • Short- Term Accommodation for Gestational Parents  – A short term absence from  academic responsibilities up to a maximum of six (6) weeks.   Short- Term  Accommodation may be extended by two (2) weeks, for a total of eight (8) weeks, where a longer absence is medically necessary. Prior to the absence students must  work with relevant university faculty and staff to adjust their course work, research,  teaching and other academic responsibilities during the period of absence. This may  include extensions of time to complete assignments, incomplete grades, and/or  dropping courses, shifting research responsibilities and adjusting TA assignments. Students who take a Short- Term Accommodation will remain enrolled.   • Formal Leave of Absence – A formal leave of absence under the Student Leave Policy.  Generally, the Student Leave Policy permits students to take a leave of absence for a full- semester, mini -semester, or for the time remaining in the semester during which  the leave is taken.  Students who take a Formal Leave of Absence (  https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student -and-student- life/student -leave.html  ) drop  all remaining courses for the semester and are unenrolled for the semester.  International students must consult with the Office of International Education (  https://www.cmu.edu/oie/  ) before considering this option due to visa implications.   Financial Assistance for Student Parents   Carnegie Mellon also offers the following options for financial assistance to students who  become parents while enrolled:   Interest Free Loan  – Any student who becomes a parent is eligible to apply for an interest - free parental loan  (https://www.cmu.edu/student -affairs/dean/loans/ ) from the Office of the  Dean of Students.   7.4 Consensual Intimate Relationship Policy Regarding Undergraduate  Students  MIIS Graduate Student Handbook  Page 30    This policy addresses the circumstances in which romantic, sexual,  or amorous  relationships/interactions with undergraduate students, even if consensual, are inappropriate  and prohibited. The purpose of this policy is to assure healthy professional relationships. This  policy is not intended to discourage consensual intimate relationships unless there is a conflicting professional relationship in which one party has authority over the other as in the policy.   https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student- and-student- life/consensual - relationships.html  7.5 Employment Eligibility Verification   If you are receiving a stipend, are a TA, or are planning to have a position with CMU then Employment Eligibility Verification is required. Form I -9 must be completed within 3 business  days of beginning work for any type of compensation (stipend or employm ent). Additional  details are highlighted below. To ensure compliance with federal law, Carnegie Mellon University maintains the Employment Eligibility Verification (I -9) Policy   https://www.cmu.edu/hr/assets/hr/restrict/employment- eligibility -verification -policy.pdf   covering the university’s I -9 and E- Verify requirements:  ● Every individual receiving a stipend from CMU or employed by CMU must comply with the I -9 Policy by completing the Form I -9 within three business days following  the first day of stipend start date/employment.   ● Individuals who expect to work on a federally funded project are further responsible for submitting an E -Verify Processing Request Form to the Office of Human  Resources if required.   ● For more information, please see CMU’s Guidance for Completing the Form I -9 and  E-Verify Requirements at CMU   https://www.cmu.edu/hr/assets/recruiting/restrict/i-9- guidance.pdf  , or  visit the Human Resources Service website to learn more about  Form I -9 and E -Verify  https://www.cmu.edu/hr/service- center/new -faculty -staff/i -9-e- verify/index.html and to schedule an appointment to complete the Form I -9  https://go.oncehub.com/I9Appointment .  ● Students who fail to complete the Form I -9 in a timely manner may have stipend  payments suspended.

Additional information on financial issues for graduate students can be  found on the web  at http://www.cmu.edu/hub/new-grad/.   Teaching assistantships are awarded to faculty members who then award these positions to  selected students. Teaching assistant duties include, but are not limited to, holding office  hours, conducting recitation classes, and grading. There are minimum English proficiency  requirements that must be met for  a student to accept a teaching assistantship. Pennsylvania  state law requires that all students who are not native speakers of English take and pass a state administered proficiency test. Support for teaching activities can be found through the  Eberly Center for Teaching Excellence, located in Warner Hall 425. Students who will be  T.A.s for the department are encouraged to visit the Teaching Center and to take advantage of the information and services located there.     Students in the professional master’s  programs are not prohibited from seeking support as  Teaching Assistants and Research Assistants.  However, typically , fulltime master’s  students  do not have time for these activities.  Research Assistantships are most likely to be awarded to  students in CMU’s research -oriented degree programs.  MIIS students can apply for TA positions only with the permission of the program director. Teaching Assistantships are especially discouraged for first semester students.   8.2 University Financial Aid   Graduate students should consult the graduate student financial aid information found on The  HUB website  (http://www.cmu.edu/finaid/graduate/index.html .)

Requirements: The Intelligent Information Systems degree offers students the flexibility to create their own course of study in consultation with their advisor.  MIIS students gain three types of practical experience: software development supervised by their advisor (24 units equivalent to two courses); a summer internship (which can be waived for students that have sufficient prior professional experience); and a capstone project executed in a group of peers (42 units equivalent to three 12-unit courses and one 6-unit course). This combination is proven to help IIS students to broaden their skills quickly. The MIIS degree is offered in two options: Option 1. Standard MIIS degree (MIIS-16) - A 16-month track that is completed in three academic semesters (fall, spring, fall) and a summer internship.   Option 2. MIIS: Advanced Study degree (MIIS-21) - A 21-month track that is completed in four academic semesters (fall, spring, fall, spring) and a summer internship. MIIS: Advanced Study track offers indepth degree in one of the following areas of concentration: Human Language for Language Technologies Language Technology Application Machine Learning for Language Technologies Part-time education option is available in some cases.  MIIS-16 students must take at least 84 units (typically 7 courses) of qualifying and elective courses that satisfy human language, machine learning, and language technology applications breadth requirements. MIIS-21 students have to take at least two more courses from the selected concentration area to satisfy their degree requirements, making it total of 108 units (typically 9 courses) of qualifying and elective courses, that also satisfy breadth requirements.

Handbook  Page 9   1  Introduction   Welcome to the Language Technologies Institute, a graduate department in the School of  Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University. You have joined a Ph.D. program that focuses on excellence, creativity, and training the next generation of research leaders. While the next few  years will be a time of hard work and intense concentration, we hope that your time at the LTI  will also be rewarding professionally and personally.   Obtaining a Ph.D. is a long and often intense journey. A healthy work -life balance helps to keep it  in perspective. Carnegie Mellon  is located in Pittsburgh, a city with a rich industrial and labor  heritage. In the past, it was the heart of the U.S. steel industry, a source  for quality packaged foods,  an important financial hub, and an early pioneer in railroads, radio, and nuclear power. This is a  city where people worked hard and made things that changed the world. Today, Pittsburgh has  reinvented itself as a leader in Computer Science and medicine, but it is still a place where people  work hard and make things that change the world . It is also an informal city, where people don’t  take themselves too seriously and remember to have fun. It is home to excellent museums, competitive professional sports teams, inexpensive magic shows, and free music during the  summer, with skiing and magnificent  state parks nearby. Your stay here will be more rewarding  if you make time for e xploring  the many activities that Pittsburgh and Southwest Pennsylvania  have to offer.  There are significant differences between CMU's different departments and degree programs in  philosophical approach, procedures, policies, and regulations. Each department issues a  handbook that informs graduate students of their program requirements and procedures and  ensures that students have written access to standard information. This handbook describes the  policies, procedures, and requirements for the Ph.D.  in Language and Information Technologies.   All policies not explicitly described in this document conform to School of Computer Science (SCS) policies and university policies. For information about Carnegie Mellon requirements and policies, please see the university’s handbook The Word , the Office of Graduate and Postdoctoral  Affairs web page , the Office of the Dean of Students web page , and other resources contained in  Appendix A of this handbook.   Welcome! We hope that your time here is a life -changing experience.   1.1 Degrees Offered   The Language Technologies Institute offers two Ph.D. programs and four Master degrees.   • Ph.D.  in Language and Information Technologies (LTI Ph.D. )  • Dual -Degree Ph.D. in Language and Information Technologies (CMU -PT Ph.D.)   • Masters in Language Technologies (MLT)   • Master of Science in Intelligent Information Systems (MIIS)   • Master of Computational Data Science  (MCDS)   • Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence and Innovation  (MSAII)  LTI Ph.D.  Graduate Student Handbook  Page 10   This handbook applies to the LTI Ph.D.   The Ph.D.  in Language and Information Technologies (LTI Ph.D. ) is focused on understanding  and extending the state of the art in computational linguistics, natural language processing,  dialogue systems, information retrieval, machine translation, speech processing,  video  understanding, multimodal systems, automated reasoning, and other topics related to analysis  and understanding of unstructured information  (e.g., machine learning, and software engineering  of intelligent systems).   1.2 Department Personnel  The people responsible for administering the LTI Ph.D.  degree are:   Jamie Callan   Ph.D. Program Director   Professor   GHC 5419  callan@cs.cmu.edu   412-268-4525  Stacey Young   Ph.D. Academic Program Manager   LTI Graduate Program Manager   GHC 6415   staceyy@cs.cmu.edu    412-268-2623   Mona Diab   LTI Director   Professor   GHC 5723  mdiab@andrew.cmu.edu   412-268-3669     Joan Axelson   Office Manager   GHC 5405   jaxelson@andrew.cmu.edu   412-268-7517    Julie Nys   Employment Processes Manger   GHC 5405   jnys@andrew.cmu.edu   412-268-3515   1.3 University Policies and Expectations  It is the responsibility of each member of the Carnegie Mellon community to be familiar with university policies and guidelines.

Some doctoral course -sections follow a separate Academic Calendar .  1.5 Carnegie Mellon University Statement of Assurance   Carnegie Mellon University does not discriminate in admission, employment, or administration  of its programs or activities on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, handicap or disability,  age, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, creed, ancestry, belief, veteran status, or genetic information.  Furthermore, Carnegie Mellon University does not discriminate and is required not  to discriminate in violation of federal, state, or local laws or executive orders.   Inquiries concerning the application of a compliance with this statement should be directed to  the university ombuds person , Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA  15213 (412 -268-1018). Obtain general information about Carnegie Mellon University by calling  412-268-2000.   Carnegie Mellon University publishes an annual campus security and fire safety report describing  the university’s security, alcohol and drug, sexual assault,  and fire safety policies, and containing  statistics about the number and type of crimes committed on campus, and the number and cause of fires in campus residence facilities during the preceding three years. You can obtain a copy by contacting the Carnegie Mellon Police Department at 412 -268-2323. The annual security and fire  safety report also is available online at www.cmu.edu/police/annualreports  .  Information regarding the applicable grievance procedures for alleged violations  of the Statement of Assurance is available at  https://www.cmu.edu/policies/forms -and-documents/soa- violations.pdf .    The Office for Institutional Equity and Title IX may be reached at 412 -268-7125  LTI Ph.D.  Graduate Student Handbook  Page 12   or  institutionalequity@cmu.edu .  1.6 The Carnegie Mellon Code  Students at Carnegie Mellon, because they are members of an academic community dedicated to  the achievement of excellence, are expected to meet the highest standards of personal, ethical,  and  moral conduct possible.    These standards require personal integrity, a commitment to honesty without compromise, as  well as truth without equivocation and a willingness to place the good of the community above the good of the self. Obligations once undertaken must be met, commitments kept.    As members of the Carnegie Mellon community, individuals are expected to uphold the standards of the community in addition to holding others accountable for said standards. It is rare that the  life of a student in an academic community can be so private that it will not affect the community  as a whole or that the above standards do not apply.   The discovery, advancement and communication of knowledge are not possible without a commitment to these standards. Creativity cannot exist without acknowledgment of the creativity of  others. New knowledge cannot be developed without credit for prior knowledge.  Without the ability to trust that these principles will be observed, an academic community cannot exist.   The commitment of its faculty, staff and students to these standards con tributes to the high  respect in which the Carnegie Mellon degree is held. Students must not destroy that respect by  their failure to meet these standards. Students who cannot meet them should voluntarily  withdraw from the university.   The Carnegie Mellon C ode can also be found here:  https://www.cmu.edu/student- affairs/theword/ .  2 The Language Technologies Institute   2.1 Pittsburgh Campus Location   The Language Technologies Institute is located primarily on the 5th and 6th floors of the  Gates  Hillman Complex (GHC) on Carnegie Mellon’s Pittsburgh campus.  The address and contact  information of the LTI are  shown below.   Language Technologies Institute   Carnegie Mellon University   5000 Forbes Avenue   Gates Hillman Complex   Pittsburgh, PA 15241 -3891  LTI Ph.D.  Graduate Student Handbook  Page 13   412-268-6298 (fax)   http://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/      Office locations for faculty, staff, and Ph.D. students can be found on the LTI website.   2.2 Office Space  Most Ph.D. students in residence on the Pittsburgh campus are given an office in which to study  and do research. Typically, offices are shared with other Ph.D. students, but they may also be shared with staff, visitors, or other members of the LTI.  Offices are assigned by the LTI’s Office Manager (see Section 1.2 , Department Personnel, for  contact information).   2.3 Mailboxes and Office Supplies   Mailboxes and office supplies are in GHC 5404.   2.4 Photocopies and Printers   Printers and photocopies are available to LTI students. The use of a photocopier or printer  requires you to log in with your CMU ID card. LTI students may use printers/photocopiers  scattered throughout the School of Computer Science buildings , but the machines in GHC 5404  and GHC 6604  are the most convenient . The SCS Computing Facilities  publishes a list of printers  online at https://computing.cs.cmu.edu/desktop/printer -list.  2.5 Computers for LTI Ph.D.  Students   Ph.D. students are responsible for having their own laptop computers to support their education  and research. Students are free to choose their own operating system (e.g., Linux, MacOs,  Windows).   Many Ph.D. advisors also provide access to computer clusters, cloud computing, or other resources to support computationally -intense research.   Ph.D. students are given access to the LTI’s computer cluster on an as- needed basis, to be used for  course assignments, directed study projects, and/or capstone projects.  The LTI cluster provides  storage and computation for projects involving large datasets and/or lengthy computation.   Ph.D. students receive two types of user ids: An Andrew id and a CS id. All CMU students have  an Andrew id. Computer Science students also have a CS id that provides access to SCS -specific  resources (e.g., computer clusters). CS ids are being phased out very slowly, so it is likely that you will need both types of user id.

It can be contacted at  help@cs.cmu.edu  , extension 8 -4231 from a campus phone, or 412 -268-4231 from an outside line   (M- F, 9am- 5pm) .  3 Standard Degree Requirements & Degree Certification                                         3.1 LTI Ph.D. Degree Requirements   To complete the Ph.D.  in Language and Information Technologies degree, the student must satisfy  the following requirements:   • Pass at least 96  units of graduate level courses, with additional requirements detailed  below ;  • Satisfy proficiencies in Writing, Presentation, Programming, and Teaching ;  • Propose , write, and defend a Ph.D.  dissertation (thesis) ;  • Attend the LTI Colloquium (11 -700) each semester ; and  • Satisfy the Research Speaking Requirement.    The sections below provide more detail about each of these requirements.   3.1.1 Course Requirements   To complete the course requirements for the Ph.D. in Language and Information Technologies  degree, the student must pass 96  or more course units of graduate courses, and meet the following  criteria:   • At least 72 units of “LTI” courses and 24  units of “SCS” courses,  • At least one class in each “LTI Focus Area”, and   • At least two labs, in two different research areas .  For definitions of quoted terms, see the section on “Definitions of LTI Terminology”.   Unless approved by the Program Director in advance, the course requirements must be satisfied  by actual classroom courses, not credit given for research or independent study.   An “LTI course ” is any 12 -unit course with a number of 11 -XXX; a  6-unit course with 11 -XXX  counts as one- half of an LTI course. Unless otherwise specified, "course" means an actual  classroom course, not  credit given for research or independent study. Note that the LTI  allow s  any one MLD (10 -XXX) graduate course to count as an "LTI course".   An “SCS course” is any 12 -unit course with a course number indicating a unit of the School of  Computer Science (including LTI); a 6 -unit course with such a number counts as one -half of an  SCS course. Unless otherwise specified, "course" means an actual classroom course, not credit given for research or independent study. Note: Recommended electives that are technically  LTI Ph.D.  Graduate Student Handbook  Page 15   outside of the SCS now count towards this requirement; for example, Digital Signal Processing in  ECE. Please see the Program Director for approval of electives as “SCS.”   “LTI Focus Areas” are sets of courses defined on the LTI course webpage under “Course Categories.” If a student believes a new course should be added to a Focus Area, they should make a request to  the Ph.D. Program Director . They  will decide, with advice from faculty in the  appropriate area, whether it should be in the Focus Area. I f approved , it will be added to the LTI  Focus Area webpage.   A “Task -Orientation Focus Course ” is a course belonging to that LTI Focus Area, as listed on  the LTI’s “Course Categories” webpage.   An LTI “ lab course ” is a course in the list of lab courses defined o n the LTI ’s “Course Categories”  webpage .  3.1.2 Grade Requirements   Students must demonstrate their mastery of material taught in courses and their success in applying their skills in directed stu dy by satisfying the following grade requirements .  Minimum grade:  Only courses with a grade of B (3.0) or higher are counted as satisfying a degree  requirement.  Pass/fail:  Pass/fail grades are not permitted for courses and projects used to satisfy a degree   requirement.  3.1.3 Proficiency Requirements   The LTI Ph.D.  does not require any Qualifying Exams.  Instead, a LTI Ph.D.  student is required to  demonstrate proficiency in the following four areas.   • Writing: This is satisfied by producing a peer -reviewed conference paper, or the  equivalent (a written report that at least two SCS faculty certify as being of conference - paper quality).     • Presentation: This is satisfied by the oral presentation of a conference paper, or the  equivalent (an oral presentation that at least t wo SCS faculty certify as being of  conference- talk quality).     • Programming:  This is satisfied by demonstrating competence in computer programming  of language technology; this is normally satisfied in the course of the student's research  and/or project work.    LTI Ph.D.  Graduate Student Handbook  Page 16   • Teaching:  This is satisfied by two (2) successful Teaching Assistantships ( TA-ships), as  determined by the faculty member for whom the student serves as TA . Typically,  one of  these will be for an undergraduate class, and one for a graduate -level class. O ne of the two  TA-ships may be in some form of pre -approved "alternate service", such as an SCS “v -unit .”     The Program Coordinator must be notified in advance of a TA-ship,  or it may not be accepted .   Graduate students are required to have a certain level of fluency in English before they can instruct in Pennsylvania, as required by the English Fluency in Higher Education Act of 1990. Through this  Act, all institutions of higher education in the state are required to evaluate and certify the English  fluency of all instructional personnel, including teaching assistants and interns. The full university policy can be reviewed at:   https://www.cmu.edu/policies/faculty/evaluation -certification -english -fluency -instructors.html   The fluency of all instructional personnel will be rated  by Language Support in the Student  Academic Success Center to determine at what level of responsibility the student can TA.   In addition to administering the International Teaching Assistant (ITA) Test (a mandatory  screening test for any non- native speake r of English), Language Support in the Student Academic  Success Center helps teaching assistants who are non -native English speakers develop fluency  and cultural understanding to teach successfully at Carnegie Mellon. Visit the Student Academic Success Center website for additional information:   https://www.cmu.edu/student- success/   3.1.4 The Ph.D. Dissertation   The Ph.D.  dissertation is the defining feature of a Ph.D.  degree. The process of completing a Ph.D.  dissertation has three important milestones.  • Thesis Topic : During the Ph.D.  student’s third year, the student should be working hard  to find a thesis topic. The thesis topic typically develops from the directed research that  the student has been carrying out with the student’s advisor.  The topic is a well- defined  research proble m that is interesting and unsolved, and for which the student has a  believable proposed solution.  When the dissertation is finished, there will be a “thesis  statement” that describes the claimed solution to the research problem that is the thesis  topic.     • Thesis Proposal:  Near the end of the student’s third year, the student will compose a  dissertation proposal. In this document, the student will specify the problem the research addresses (the thesis topic); the significance of the problem and expected scie ntific  contributions; other relevant research, including competing approaches; some preliminary results; the work that still must be completed; evaluation metrics for that work; and a LTI Ph.D.  Graduate Student Handbook  Page 17   projected timeline for completion. Before presenting the proposal, the student will also  secure approval for a dissertation committee, which consists of the student’s advisor, at least two other SCS faculty members working in language technologies, and at least one external member.    University rules require that the time and place of the proposal presentation be publicly announced at least one week before the presentation. The student should coordinate this with the Ph.D.  Program Coordinator. The public thesis proposal protects the student by  guaranteeing that the proposed research is interesting to the larger scientific community and demonstrating that the student will finish the program if the work is completed as outlined.     • Thesis Defense:  The dissertation document itself, normally expected at the end of the fifth  year, will include a detailed description of all the work done, including a clear evaluation  and a discussion of its scientific contributions. There are no fixed style or document length guidelines or requirements; the only format requirement is that the title page should be suitable to be issued as an LTI Technical Report. The dissertation defense is a public  presentation and defense of the dissertation results.     Note: University rules again require that the time and place of the dissertation defense be publicly an nounced at least one week prior to the defense. This should also be coordinated  with Ph.D.  Program Coordinator.     Note: At the time of the public announcement, a draft of the thesis document must be  made available online.   3.1.5 Research Speaking Requirement   To emphasize student research, improve public speaking skills and increase internal awareness of LTI work, all LTI Ph.D.  students must complete an oral presentation at the LTI each year (by  the end of May). The presentation should consist of a 20- minute ta lk plus time for discussion. It  must be advertised to the LTI mailing lists at least one week before your presentation, and the public will be invited. (The thesis proposal and defense each count towards this requirement.)   At least two LTI faculty members will attend the presentation, including the research advisor.  After the presentation, these faculty members will convene and provide written feedback to both the student and the Program Director  of graduate programs (the form for this is available on the  LTI website). This feedback will help the student refine speaking skills with respect to talk  structure, content,  and delivery.   3.2 Advising   Each student has a faculty advisor charged with guiding the education and monitoring the  progress of the student through the program. The advisor also supervises the student's directed LTI Ph.D.  Graduate Student Handbook  Page 18   study projects. This personal student -advisor relationship ensures that every student receives the  necessary faculty mentoring. The advisor also provides the student with career advice.   How a nd when the advisor is selected  (The Matching  Process) : Advisors are selected during  the first month of the program. Students are expected to attend the LTI's Orientation lectures,   (Section 3.3) in which faculty describe their interests and areas of expertise, and to be proactive  about meeting individually with potential advisors. After meeting with several potential advisors,  each student will be asked to indicate a first, second and third choice for advisor. Meanwhile,  the  potential advisors determine how many new students they can take and  indicate their  preferences. Finally, the entire LTI faculty meets as a " Matching  Committee" to determine the best  set of matches.   Until a student finds a specific advisor, the Progr am Director  of the LTI graduate programs serves  as the advisor.   How to change advisors:  The initial advisor selection should be made carefully. However, it is  possible to change advisors. To do so, the student should find another faculty member willing to  serve as an advisor, and then make a request to the Program Director to switch advisors. The LTI  follows the long- standing SCS policy that both the new and old advisors need to agree to the  change; typically, this is not a problem (assuming the new advisor  has agreed in advance, as  described here). It is to the student's advantage to avoid switching advisors, especially late in their graduate studies, because forging a strong student -advisor relationship takes time.   3.3 LTI Orientation   At the beginning of each Fall semester, the LTI provides 2 -3 weeks of lectures and talks to help  students learn about the work done by CMU faculty and to provide an opportunity for advisors to recruit new students. Students are expected to attend them and treat them as seriously a s a  standard course, because they provide a good introduction to the broad range of research done at  the LTI. Students do not register for the LTI Orientation, nor do they receive a grade; however, the department is serious about its expectation that new students will attend these talks.   For many years, these talks were called "the Immigration Course (IC)." The intuition behind this  name is that the talks help orient newly -arrived students – immigrants into the CMU  environment. As a result, some students u nderstood the name to indicate that the talks would be  about US immigration and visa requirements. The older name has been retired; however, people who have been at CMU a long time may occasionally use the older name .  3.4 End of Semester Evaluation   Near the e nd of each semester, the student must prepare a statement that describes his or her  achievements in the current semester and plans for the next semester.   At the end of the semester, the faculty evaluates each student's academic progress. The student's  advisor serves as the student's advocate in this process. The result of the evaluation is a letter from LTI Ph.D.  Graduate Student Handbook  Page 19   the faculty to the student that indicates whether the student is making satisfactory progress  towards completing the degree.   A good letter typically indicates that the student is making satisfactory progress. If the student is doing exceptionally good work, a stronger adjective such as excellent might be used, but this is unusual.   If a student seems to be having trouble, the faculty determines whether it believes that the student  can finish the degree, and if so, what needs to be accomplished to get back on track. This type of  letter should be considered a serious warning. It is not a permanent "black mark" on the student's record; if the student begins makin g satisfactory progress again, there is no official record of the  letter in the student's transcript.  In the most serious cases, the faculty gives the student an “N -1” letter that specifies a list of  conditions that the student must satisfy by specific deadlines. Failure to meet all t he specified  conditions may result in the student's termination from the program.   3.5 Electives Outside of SCS   Students may  take elective courses outside the SCS, at Carnegie Mellon or cross -registered at the  University of Pittsburgh, as long as the student fulfills the requirements of their program as  described above. The student should discuss any such electives in advance w ith their advisor .  Typical choices might include ECE courses for Speech students, Pitt Linguistics courses, or  Statistics courses.   Students interested in taking recommended electives outside the SCS should pay particular  attention to the following issues.  • Recommended electives outside of the SCS count towards the “SCS” course requirement. Please see the Program Director for approval of an elective as an “SCS  course” .   • Students need advance approval for any courses not covered by their normal tuition (e.g.,   summer courses).   • The grading of outside courses is the responsibility of the department offering the course; however, the LTI's Minimum Course Grade Policy described above still applies (“B” is the minimum for Ph.D. ).   3.6 Completing a n M.S. Degree Enroute t o a Ph.D.  Courses that satisfy LTI Ph.D. degree requirements may also be used to satisfy requirements for  one M.S. degree. The most common choice is the LTI’s Master of Language Technologies (MLT)  degree because its requirements are similar (but not identical) to the Ph.D. requirements. Other M.S. degrees within the LTI and outside of the LTI are also possible.  LTI Ph.D.  Graduate Student Handbook  Page 20   Students interested in an M.S. degree other than the MLT degree should  discuss their plans with  their Ph.D. advisor due to the additional courses and project work that may be involved.   3.7 Grading and Evaluation   3.7.1 University Policy on Grades   Carnegie Mellon’s Grading  policy offers details concerning university grading principles for  students taking courses and covers the specifics of assigning and c hanging grades, grading  options, drop/ withdrawals, and course repeats.   It also defines the undergraduate and graduate  grading standards.   Process for Appealing Final Grades   Final grades will be changed only in exceptional circumstances and only with the approval of the  instructor and the department, unit, or program.   Grading is a matter of sound discretion of the instructor and final grades are rarely changed without the consent of the instructor who assigned the grade. The following circumstances are  the unusual exceptions that may warrant a grade appeal: (a) the final grade assigned for a course  is based on manifest error (e.g., a clear error such as arithmetic error in computing a grade or  failure to grade one of the answers on an exam), or (b) the faculty or staff member who assigned the grade did so in violation of a university  policy.   See the university’s Summary of Graduate Student Appeal and Grievance Procedures  web page  for more information.  https://www.cmu.edu/student -affairs/theword/academic/appeal -of- grades -and-academic- actions.html   3.7.2 University Policy on Grades for Transfer Courses   https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student- and-student -life/transfer- credit - evaluation -and-assignment.html   Carnegie Mellon University offers students the opportunity to take courses for credit through a cross- registration program (see Pittsburgh Council on Higher Education (PCHE) and Cross- registration below) and through the receipt of transfer credit from othe r accredited institutions.  The Carnegie Mellon University transcript will include information on such courses as follows: Carnegie Mellon courses and courses taken through the university's cross -registration program  will have grades recorded on the transcr ipt and be factored into the QPA. All other courses will  be recorded on this transcript indicating where the course was taken, but without grade. Such courses will not be taken into account for academic actions, honors or QPA calculations.    LTI Ph.D.  Graduate Student Handbook  Page 21   3.8 Academic Integrity   In the midst of self- exploration, the high demands of a challenging academic environment can  create situations where some students have difficulty exercising good judgment. Academic  challenges can provide many opportunities for high standards to evolv e if students actively reflect  on these challenges and if the community supports discussions to aid in this process. It is the  responsibility of the entire community to establish and maintain the integrity of our university.   Carnegie Mellon University edu cates its students to become professionals who will serve society  with integrity. The university also creates and disseminates new knowledge and expressions of  knowledge in ways that benefit society.   Carnegie Mellon strives to serve the changing needs of society through the three primary goals outlined in its mission statement: T o create and disseminate knowledge and art through research  and artistic expression, teaching and learning and transfer to society; to serve students by teaching them leadership, problem- solving skills, and the values of quality, ethical behavior,  responsibility to society and commitments to work; and to pursue the advantages provided by a  diverse community, open to the exchange of ideas, where discovery and artistic creativity can   flourish.   In any presentation, creative, artistic or research, it is the ethical responsibility of each student to  identify the conceptual sources of the work submitted. Failure to do so is dishonest and is the basis for a charge of cheating or plagiarism, which is subject to disciplinary action.   Please review the University Policy on Academic Integrity .  The policy includes the University expectations around academic integrity and provides  definitions of cheating, plagiarism, and unauthorized assistance.   A review of the University’s Academic Disciplinary Actions  procedures is also recommended.   Important note: The LTI implements the above policy’s option of “conven[ing] a disciplinary  hearing according to the procedures of the department/program.” Our procedure is as follows: A first violation is grounds for dismissal from the graduate program. If we decide not to immediately dismiss, the first violation will result in the student being on disciplinary probation.   If the student commits a second violation while on probation, the penalty is dismissal from the  graduate program.  These procedures outline the process for investigating, reporting, and adjudicating violations of  the University Policy on Academic Integrity. The procedures also outline the appeal process.   Please see the Appeals of Course Level Action section  of The Word and the  Office of Community  Standards & Integrity w eb page for more information.  LTI Ph.D.  Graduate Student Handbook  Page 22   3.9 Withdrawal of a Degree  The University reserves the right to withdraw a degree even though it has been granted should  there be discovery that the work upon which it was based or the academic records in support of it had been falsified. In such a case, withdrawal of the degree will occur promptly upon discovery of the falsification. See the university’s Withdrawal of a Degree  policy for more information.   3.10 Employment Eligibility Verification   If you are receiving a stipend, are a TA, or are planning to have a position with CMU then Employment Eligibility Verification is required. Form I -9 must be completed within 3 business  days of beginning work for any type of compensation (stipend or employment). Additional details are highlighted below. To ensure compliance with federal law, Carnegie Mellon University  maintains the Employment Eligibility Verification (I- 9) Policy [pdf] covering the university’s  I-9 and E -Verify requirements :  • Every individual receiving a stipend from CMU or employed by CMU must comply with  the I -9 Policy by completing the Form I -9 within three business days following the first  day of stipend start date/employment.   • Individuals who expect to work on a federally  funded project are further responsible for  submitting an E -Verify Processing Request Form to the Office of Human Resources if  required.   • For more information, please see CMU’s Guidance for Completing the Form I -9 and E - Verify Requirements at CMU [pdf] , or visit the Human Resources Service website to  learn more about Form I -9 and E -Verify and to schedule an appointment to complete the  Form I -9.  • Students who fail to complete the Form I -9 in a timely manner may have stipend payments  suspended.   If employed by the university, an individual who fails to timely complete the  Form I -9 may be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination of  employment.   For more information :  • See CMU’s Guidance for Completing the Form I -9 and E -Verify Requirements at CMU ,  or  • Visit the Human Resources Service website to learn more about Form I -9 and E -Verify   and to schedule an appointment to complete the Form I -9.”  3.11 Additional Guidance for Students  LTI Ph.D.  Graduate Student Handbook  Page 23   3.11.1 Program of Study    Students seeking guidance about their program of study and degree requirements should consult  with their academic advisor and/or appropriate associate dean.   3.11.2  Financial Aid and Student Account    Students are expected to make normal progress toward their degree in order to graduate within the standard timeframe for their program of study. Under U.S. Federal Title IV regulations, student eligibility for federal financial aid is contingent upon enrollment in and successful completion of courses that are counted as credit toward their current degree program. To receive the maximum amount of federal financial aid for which they may be eligible, students must enroll each se mester in at least 36 units that count toward their current degree level. (See separate  guidance regarding integrated degree completion.)    Students should consult with their designated college liaison in The HUB regarding billing and financial aid, particu larly for early completion, longer -than -standard completion, or integrated  undergraduate and master’s degree programs.     3.11.3  International Students   Immigration status for students in F- 1 and J- 1 non -immigrant status is tied to making normal  progress toward completing degree requirements. Therefore, F -1 and J -1 students who are  considering completing their degree requirements early, anticipating longer -than -standard  completion, or moving from an undergraduate to a graduate student classification (integ rated  undergraduate -graduate study) should consult with their designated advisor in the Office of  International Education (OIE) to ensure compliance with immigration regulations.   4 Ph.D.  Academic Policies   4.1 Duration of Study   The target duration of the LTI Ph.D.  is five years, although six years is also common.   Carnegie Mellon graduate students are expected to complete their degree requirements within the standard length of time for their program of study as outlined in this Graduate Student Handbook. Upon completion of the graduate program degree requirements, the degree will be certified by the student’s academic program in the semester in which the student completes the  requirements.   Early Completion   The Ph.D. is granted when  all degree requirements are satisfied. Some students complete the  program in fewer than five years.  LTI Ph.D.  Graduate Student Handbook  Page 24   Extended or Longer- than -Standard Competition   Longer- than -standard degree completion may occur due to academic interruptions in making  progress toward the d egree as defined by the academic program, interruptions of full -time study  or progress towards the degree due to serious, documented medical issues, or other unusual or  unforeseen circumstances.   Doctoral students who require an extended period to complete their degree requirements must consult with their academic program and  are subject to the CMU Policy on Doctoral Student  Status (https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student -and-student -life/doctoral -student -status.html),  specifically the “Time to Degree. ”  4.1.1 Departm ent Policy on Double Counting Courses   An LTI Ph.D.  student who uses courses taken as a M aster ’s degree student (at Carnegie Mellon  or elsewhere) toward their program requirements cannot use those same courses toward any  other Master’s degree offered by the school . The LTI (like other SCS units) allows its Ph.D.   students who have passed the requirements for an LTI Master’s degree to receive the master’s   degree without any additional work. Any other sharing of coursework by an LTI student between  more than on e CMU degree (e.g., receiving an MLD Master’s  degree that includes courses taken  as an LTI Ph.D.  student) must be explicitly approved by the LTI, on a case -by-case basis, in  advance.   4.1.2 External Internships   The LTI provides summer support for its Ph.D.  students, so Ph.D. students are expected to do  research at Carnegie Mellon during the summer. However, outside experience can be a valuable  educational experience, Ph.D. students in good standing  are allowed to do an e xternal internship.  Some  students may  benefit from more than one internship, especially if they require access to  proprietary data for their work, thus , with the approval of the student’s advisor, a student can intern up  to four (4) times during their Ph.D. degree. Interning more than four ( 4) times requires approval  from the Ph.D. P rogram Director.   Any internship must be planned in consultation with the student’s advisor and the LTI Ph.D.   Coordinator. If an internship is part of a fully -funded external fellowship (e.g., Microsoft Research  Fellowship), the student does not need prior LTI approval, but should still coordinate with their  advisor. International students must consult with Office of International Education (OIE) for eligibility before seeking an internship or signing an offer contract.   Internships are typically scheduled during the summer. In certain cases,  it is possible to schedule  an internship during the fall or spring semester; the details are complex, especially for international students, so the student should discuss this as early as possible with the Ph.D.  Program Director . International students must coordinate carefully with the LTI in any event, due  to visa restrictions.  LTI Ph.D.  Graduate Student Handbook  Page 25   Note that self- funded Ph.D.  students (e.g., those registered for five units while on semester  interns hip) are not permitted to receive a partial stipend for the semester of their internship, while  full- time LTI -sponsored students are eligible for a partial stipend.   All students are caution ed to be aware of potential intellectual property (IP) problems with  internships, and to review any IP agreements with their advisors before signing them. It is possible  to lose ownership of your ideas.   If the student is to receive academic credit for the internship,  it must have deliverables from the  student commensurate with the number of units,  they are taking. This can be in the form of  interim and final reports on the experience, presentations in the following semester regarding the experience, assessments of their experience as it relates to their course of study, etc.   4.1.3 Maximum Courseload   Ph.D.  students are permitted to register for a maximum of 54  units of coursework per semester.   4.1.4 Pass/Fail Grades   Pass/fail grades are not permitted for courses used to satisfy a degree requirement.   Graduate students who are required to take additional undergraduate courses to build up the core  foundations of computer science may not elect the pass/fail option for th ese courses.   4.1.5 Transfer Credit   An equivalent graduate course previously completed at another institution may be permitted to  satisfy one of the Ph.D.  course requirements. The decision on whether a course may be transferred  is made by the Ph.D.  Program Direct or.   Typically,  the student will provide the Program Director with the syllabus of the external course,  and the Program Director will use that and the student’s transcript to make the decision.   See the section on “Definition of transfer credit versus cour se exemption .”  A student may not receive transfer credit for more than four courses.   4.1.6 Residency Requirements   The university requires Ph.D. s to spend at least one year of residency at Carnegie Mellon.   The SCS requires that all Ph.D.  students must take at Carnegie Mellon a minimum of 48  units of  the total coursework required by their respective programs. LTI Ph.D.  Graduate Student Handbook  Page 26   4.1.7 Transferring Into the Ph.D.  Program   The LTI does not allow direct transfers from its master’s programs into its Ph.D.  program . The  student must apply for the Ph.D.  at the usual time . However, students that are already enrolled in  an LTI degree program are not required to retake GRE and TOEFL exams or to produce new  transcripts from other universities.   4.1.8 Transferring Out of the Ph.D.  Program   The Ph.D.  program doe s not prevent students from transferring to another degree program . A  student who is interested in transferring out of the Ph.D.  degree program should consult the  handbook and Program Director of the desired degree program to learn whether transfers are permitted, and if so, how, and when to request such a transfer.   4.2 LTI Academic Policies   4.2.1 “Grandfather” Policy   A student can graduate under the policies in effect at the time that the student entered the  program; or, at the student's choice, the student can graduate under policies that are adopted after  the student entered the program. If it is not realistic to follow a particular policy  exactly, the  department may approximate the policy as closely as possible; this situation is rare and typically arises only when a student is enrolled in the program for an extended period of time.   4.2.2 Definition of Transfer Credit  vs. Course Exemption   The LT I may grant transfer credit  or issue an exemption for equivalent graduate courses previously  completed at another institution. This decision rests with the director  of the particular program.   If a student is exempt  from a required course due to prior cour ses or experience, the student can  replace that course with an open elective. The student does not receive credit for the external course but  can take any course that could normally count toward the degree in its place.   If a student receives credit  for pr ior coursework completed at CMU or elsewhere, the student  receives that many units of credit, and the total amount of required coursework is reduced by that  amount.   4.2.3 External Employment/Consulting   Students funded by LTI research projects are expected to wor k primarily for those projects. Since  consulting provides useful experience, students are generally permitted to consult at most one  day per seven- day week, with the advisor's consent . International students must also have  approval in advance from the Office of International Education (OIE) ; otherwise, they may be in  violation of their visa status. See also External Internships.  LTI Ph.D.  Graduate Student Handbook  Page 27   4.2.4  Leave of Absence   The LTI discourages Leaves of Absence (LOA), since students usually do not return, despite good  intentions. However, a student in good standing may be granted a LOA of at most 1 year, upon written request to the Ph.D. Program Director and with consent of t he student's advisor. It is the  responsibility of the student on LOA to contact the LTI to initiate a return to the program.   Students taking or returning from a leave of absence must follow the university’s  leave of absence  process.   4.2.5 Satisfactory Progress   If a student does not make satisfactory progress each semester toward completing the degree, the   LTI may remove the m from the program . See section on “End of Semester Evaluation .”  4.2.6 Time Away from Academic Responsibilities   Ph.D. s tudents that are supported by sponsored research, fellowships, or scholarships are  expected to remain on campus and work fu lltime on their education and research throughout the  year, regardless of whether classes are in session or not. 40 hours per week is a common level of  effort.   Ordinarily, students are not expected to work during official university holidays , however  students may need to consult their advisor about expectations and alternate arrangements if there  are challenges with taking time off during a university holiday, for example, if an experiment requires continuous monitoring. In such situations, the student and their advisor may agree for  the student to take an equal number of days off at another time.  Students with fulltime financial support are entitled to four weeks per  year of paid vacation ,  which must be scheduled in consultation with the ir advisor .  4.3 CMU Academic Policies   4.3.1 Drop/Add/Withdraw Procedures   Add, drop, withdrawals, and pass/no pass election procedures and deadlines are described on a  Hub web page . Note that the deadlines for doctoral courses may differ slightly; see the deadlines  for doctoral course sections in the Academic Calendar .   Doctoral students, visiting/non -degree students, and certificate students do not receive vouchers  and do not participate in the voucher process.  LTI Ph.D.  Graduate Student Handbook  Page 28   4.3.2 Doctoral Student Status  Carnegie Mellon’s Policy for Doctoral Student Status  covers time limits on doctoral degree  student status, a defi nition of All But Dissertation status, a definition of In Residence (ABD) and In  Absentia  (ABS) status for doctoral students and the tuition and fees charged for students In  Residence and students In Absentia .  4.3.3 ABD versus ABD in Absentia (ABS)   Following university policy, an LTI Ph.D.  student is considered "All -But-Dissertation" (ABD)  when they have completed all requirements for the LTI's Ph.D.  degree except for the thesis defense  (in particular, the student has had a thesis proposal accepted). Note that ABD status is different  from ABD in absentia (ABS) status. A student in ABS status cannot receive any support from the university (including an y research projects within the university), cannot use most university  facilities, and does not pay any tuition until they are ready to defend their thesis. ABS students must register for five (5) units of dissertation research in the semester they defend;  in keeping  with university policy, the LTI (and its projects and faculty) cannot pay for these five units. The  student can (and should) register for these five units only after they defend; just in case the defense  date slips to the next semester.   Student s entering ABD or ABS status must complete the All But Dissertations Status Agreement .  4.3.4 Statute of Limitations: Time to Degree   As outlined in the Doctoral Student Status Policy , students will complete all requirements for the  Ph.D. degree within a maximum of ten years from original matriculation as a doctoral student, or less if required by a more restrictive department or college policy. Once this time -to-degree limit  has lapsed, the person may resume work towards a doctoral degree only if newly admitted to a currently offered doctoral degree program under criteria determined by that program. Under extraordinary circumstances, such as leave of absence, military or public service, family or parental leave, or temporary disability, a school or college may, upon the relevant departmen t's  recommendation and with the written approval of the dean, defer the lapse of All But Dissertation status for a period commensurate with the duration of that interruption. Students, who are pursuing the Ph.D. degree as part- time students for all semesters of their program, as approved by  their program, may also appeal to their program or department for extension of the time to degree limit.   Under extraordinary circumstances, such as leave of absence, military or public service, family or parental leave, or temporary disability, a school or college may, upon the relevant department’s  recommendation and with the written approval of the dean, defer the lapse of All But Dissertation status for a period commensurate with the duration of that interruption.  LTI Ph.D.  Graduate Student Handbook  Page 29   Students, who are pursuing the Ph.D. degree as part- time students for all semesters of their  program, as approved by their program, may also appeal to their program or department for  extension of the time to degree limit.   4.3.5 University  Financial Aid   Graduate  students should consult the graduate student financial aid information  found on The  HUB website.  Students will find the Graduate Financial Aid Guide, information about funding options and how to apply for financial aid and other helpful links.   4.3.6 Assistance for Individuals with Disabilities   The Office of Disability Resources at Carnegie Mellon University has a continued mission to  provide physical, digital, and programmatic access to ensure that students with disabilities have  equal access to their educational experience. We work to ensure that qualified individuals receive reasonable accommodations as guaranteed by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Students who would like to receive accommodations can begin the process through Disability Resources'  secu re online portal  (https://rainier.accessiblelearning.com/cmu/ ) or email access@andrew.cmu.edu  to begin the  interactive accommodation process. Students with physical, sensory, cognitive, or emotional disabilities are encouraged to self -identify with the Office of Disability Resources and request  needed accommodations. Any questions about the process can be directed to  access@andrew.cmu.edu  , or call (412) 268 -6121.    4.3.7 Summary of Graduate Student Appeal and Grievance Procedures   Graduate students will find the Summary of Graduate Student Appeal and Grievance Procedures   on the Graduate Education Resource webpage.  This document summarizes processes available to  graduate students who seek review of academic and non -academic issues. Generally, graduate  students are expected to seek informal resolution of all concerns within the applicable department, unit, or program before invok ing formal processes. When an informal resolution  cannot be reached, however, a graduate student who seeks further review of the matter is to follow the formal procedures outlined here . These appeal and grievance procedures shall apply to  students in all graduate programs of the University. Students should refer to the department  specific information in this handbook for department and college information about the  administration and academic policies of the program.   4.3.8 Sexual Misconduct Policy   The University  prohibits sex -based discrimination, sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating/  domestic violence,  and stalking. The University also prohibits retaliation against individuals who  bring forward such concerns or allegations in good faith.   LTI Ph.D.  Graduate Student Handbook  Page 30   The University’s S exual Misconduct Policy is available at   https://www.cmu.edu/policies/administrative -and-governance/sexual -misconduct/index.html   The University’s Policy Against Retaliation is available at :  https://www.cmu.edu/policies/administrative -and-governance/whistleblower.html   If you have been impacted by any of these issues, you are encouraged to make contact with any of  the following resources:   • Office for Institutional Equity and Title IX : 412 -268-7125,  institutionalequity@cmu.edu   • On campus resources for institutional equity and Title IX    • University Police : 412-268-2323    Additional resources and information can be found at:  https://www.cmu.edu/title -ix/resources- and-information/index.html   4.3.9 Gestational and Parental Accommodations   Providing holistic student support is a top priority at Carnegie Mellon. The protocols described  at https://www.cmu.edu/graduate/programs -services/maternity -accommodation -protocol.html   are designed to support the parental needs of students and their families.   Students seeking any of the Parental Accommodations described below must register with  the Office of the Dea n of Students by contacting the office for an appointment by calling 412 - 268- 2075.   Students are encouraged to register with the Office of the Dean of Students ninety (90) days in  advance of the anticipated arrival of the child as applicable in the individual circumstance.   At the  time of registering, students will have the opportunity to consult about resources, procedures, funding options and preparation for discussing academic accommodations with the student’s academic department.   Students should also co nsult with their academic advisors either before or  in conjunction with registering with the Office of the Dean of Students.   4.3.10  Accommodations for Gestational Parents  The birth of a child is a significant life event that may require time away from academic pu rsuits  for delivery and recovery from delivery of a newly born child. Students whose anticipated delivery date is during the course of a semester may need to take time away from their academic responsibilities. Carnegie Mellon students seeking time away are afforded two options as possible accommodation:   • Short -Term Accommodation for Gestational Parents  – A short term absence from  academic responsibilities up to a maximum of six (6) weeks.   Short- Term Accommodation LTI Ph.D.  Graduate Student Handbook  Page 31   may be extended by two (2) weeks, for a tot al of eight (8) weeks, where a longer absence  is medically necessary. Prior to the absence students must work with relevant university  faculty and staff to adjust their course work, research, teaching and other academic  responsibilities during the period of absence. This may include extensions of time to  complete assignments, incomplete grades, and/or dropping courses, shifting research  responsibilities and adjusting TA assignments. Students who take a Short -Term  Accommodation will remain enrolled.   • Formal Leave of Absence – A formal leave of absence under the Student Leave Policy.  Generally, the Student Leave Policy permits students to take a leave of absence for a full- semester, mini- semester, or for the time remaining in the semester during which the leave  is taken.   Students who take a Formal Leave of Absence  (https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student- and-student -life/student- leave.html ) drop all  remaining courses for the semester and are unenrolled for the semester. International  students must consult with the Office of International Education  (https://www.cmu.edu/oie/ ) before considering this option due to visa implications.   4.3.11  Parental Accommodation for Doctoral Students     The university offers a Parental Accommodation for qualifying doctoral student parents to include  up to four (4) weeks of time away from academic responsibilities with continued stipend support. This accommodation can be utilized within six months of the birth or placement of a child  through adoption, foster care or legal guardianship. Gestational parents may utilize both the  Short- Term Accommodation  for Gestational Parents and the parental accommodation.   Careful planning and consultation is necessary given the unique contexts and requirements of each student’s situation. Students will remain fully enrolled and will receive assistance in  navigating the necessary planning and consultation processes.   4.3.12  Financial Assistance for Student Parents  Carnegie Mellon also offers the following options for financial assistance to students who become  parents while enrolled:   Interest Free Loan – Any student who becomes a parent is eligible to apply for an interest - free parental loan  (https://www.cmu.edu/student -affairs/dean/loans/ ) from the Office of the Dean  of Students.    Doctoral Stipend Continuation (Gestational Parents) – Doctoral students who are the  gestational parent and who receive an academic stipend funded by Carnegie Mellon are eligible to continue to receive stipend funding for up to six (6) weeks during a Short -Term  Accommodation for Gestational Parents or during a Formal Leave of Absence. Continued LTI Ph.D.  Graduate Student Handbook  Page 32   academic stipend funding may be extended by two (2) weeks, for a total of eight (8) weeks, if an  absence longer than six weeks is medically necessary.    Doctoral Sti pend Continuation (Non- gestational Parents) – Doctoral students who receive an  academic stipend funded by Carnegie Mellon and are becoming a parent by adoption, birth, or through guardianship are eligible to continue to receive stipend funding for up to fo ur (4) weeks  during a Short- Term Parental Accommodation.    4.3.13   Consensual Intimate Relationship Policy Regarding Undergraduate  Students    This policy addresses the circumstances in which romantic, sexual  or amorous  relationships/interactions with undergraduate students, even if consensual, are inappropriate and prohibited. The purpose of this policy is to assure healthy professional relationships. This policy is not intended to discourage consensual intimate relationships unless there is a conflicting professional relationship in which one party has authority over the other as in the policy.   https://www.cmu.ed u/policies/student -and-student -life/consensual -relationships.html   5 Financial Support   5.1 Graduate Student Funding   For all LTI Ph.D.  students, full funding (tuition plus stipend) is guaranteed for the first year . This  support is normally continued for at least 5 years, with possibility of further continuance, subject to continuing satisfactory progress and availability of funding. The fellowship includes full tuition  and fees, and a monthly Ph.D.  stipend that is fixed across SCS. In addition, the LTI pays a  dependency allowance of 10% of the student's monthly stipend to any student with a child, unless they have a spouse who earns more than $200 per month.   The impact of outside fellowships and scholarships on departmental support -decrease by the  amount, added bonus, etc.   If a Ph.D.  student receives an outside graduate fellowship (e.g., NSF, Fulbright), the student is  expected to accept it in place of the LTI’s graduate fellowship. As an extra incentive to do so, the LTI will supplement the award so that the student will receive full tuition and a combined stipend 10 percent higher than that of the standard LTI graduate fellowship.   Studen ts are required to inform the LTI about any external funding that they receive.   See also the section on “ABD versus ABD in Absentia (ABS) ” (Section 4.3.3 ).   5.2 Conference Travel Funding  LTI Ph.D.  Graduate Student Handbook  Page 33   Students funded by research projects receive travel funding according to policies set by the  individual projects. Students who have no project funding may be provided with partial funding,  with a larger amount available for travel to p resent a refereed conference paper . There is an LTI  form that must be filled out in advance.  5.3 Research Funding   GuSH Research Funding is a source of small research grant funds provided by the Graduate Student Assembly (GSA) and the Provost’s Office and manag ed by the Office of Graduate and  Postdoc Affairs.

329	What is a Tartan?  The Carnegie Mellon athletic teams are nicknamed the "Tartans" as a nod to Andrew Carnegie's Scottish heritage. A tartan is often misrepresented as a fierce warrior from either the Asian tundra or Scottish highlands. In actuality, a Tartan is a twilled woolen fabric with a plaid design. It is of Scottish origin and consists of stripes of various colors and widths against a solid ground, denoting a particular family lineage. The school's founder, Andrew Carnegie, was born in Dunfermline, Scotland, in 1835. Carnegie came to the United States in 1848 and founded Carnegie Technical Schools in Pittsburgh in 1900.  The Scottish terrier mascot performer sports Carnegie tartan attire, while the graphic mascot is wearing a plaid scarf around its neck.

354	The starting line from the inaugural race in June 1920 was outside what is now known as the College of Fine Arts building. Racers then traveled toward Margaret Morrison Carnegie Hall, went up Tech Street, down through Schenley Park and then turned back to campus. Buggies would then take pit stops and have their rear wheels swapped before heading back toward the starting line.  Alpha Kappa Psi, the first sorority to enter a Buggy on race day, in 1922.  Delta Upsilon entered a three-wheeled buggy in 1940.   It’s quirky, it’s different, and it’s so Carnegie Mellon University, where the college experience is a little buggy.  Sweepstakes, better known as the Spring Carnival Buggy Races, will celebrate its 100th anniversary April 17-18, 2020. The CMU tradition is unlike any other.  Since the first Campus Week in 1920, when “chariots” were built to race around campus, student groups have been working year-round, using their engineering skills, design expertise and penchant for interdisciplinary collaboration to secretly build, modify and refine the most aerodynamic, torpedo-like vessel they call a “buggy.”     The buggies are pushed by a team of five pushers and steered by drivers often less than 5 feet, 3 inches tall, who lay prone, strapped inside the three-wheeled carbon fiber tube. The buggy is pushed up Hills 1 and 2 of Tech Street, roll freely — up to nearly 40 miles per hour— down and around Schenley Drive to the hard, right-hand turn on Frew Street, known as the “chute.” From there, they are pushed up Hills 3, 4, and 5 to complete the 0.84-mile, or 4,418-feet course.  “Buggy doesn’t exist anywhere else. It’s a 100-year love of creation and collaboration,” said Olivia Keller at dawn on the inaugural morning practice — called first rolls — in late September. “That the alumni network can be so involved, that they continue to be passionate about buggy long after they’ve gone is very telling of how amazing and special buggy is. It’s part of the CMU experience,” said the senior chemical engineering major, pusher and chair of this year’s Kappa Kappa Gamma and Kappa Sigma teams.   Ben Matzke is one such passionate alumnus. A 2011 mechanical engineering graduate, Matzke, former chair of the student group CIA (Carnegie Involvement Association), is chair of the Buggy Alumni Association's Centennial Planning Committee. He attended the first rolls to officially kick off the 100th anniversary season.   “Buggy is a sport that encompasses all elements that CMU has to offer,” he said. “Everything that goes into it, the challenge, the teamwork, the fun, the rewards. It’s a real-life challenge working with a team. I learned to work together with people with different personalities and visions toward the same goal to make it happen.”   The war is over, and we won! This week, the 100 Years of Buggy History series brings back Fraternities, Spring Carnival, and most importantly, Buggy! The post-war era brought a whole new style of buggy, but also brought with it some controversies. It also saw the entry of multiple non-Greek organizations for the first time! (As a reminder, the Men’s Dorms were permitted to enter in 1928, though it’s unclear if they actually did).  1946 Raceday: Prelims on Friday, May 3 at 4:30pm; Finals on Saturday, May 11* at 2:00pm  Sweepstakes Committee: John H. Siepel (Chair)  Race Results: (1) DTD (3:49?); (2) KapSig; (DQ) PiKA  Design Comp: (1) Beta  Weather: Cloudy, High 66/Low 47 on Friday; Rain on Saturday, May 4; Overcast, High 67/Low 49 on Saturday, May 11  1946 saw the return of Buggy, though not all of the Fraternities were back yet. It also saw a rain delay and a very controversial result.  Buggy is Back!  The War is over, and Spring Carnival is back with Buggy!  The first year back was a short one though, as Spring Carnival was only a 2-day event, kicking off with Buggy at 4:30pm on Friday.  The field was small (only 9 teams), as not all of the fraternities on campus had reactivated following the War. Buggy secrecy came back as well, as the April 30, 1946 Tartan reported that DU was building their new buggy off-campus, and were so secretive about it that not even their brothers had seen it yet! And On New Roads!  This is the first record we have of the roads being paved!  2 weeks before Raceday, the City of Pittsburgh re-paved the Buggy course, allowing the buggies to race on fresh roadways.  Pittsburgh Police were also out in full force on Raceday to assist with course control…Though as you’ll see, this was probably only during the Prelims. New Rules in Place.  The April 9, 1946 Tartan printed the 12 rules for Buggy, our first look at the rules in several years.  A lot of the rules carried over from the pre-war era, including that track and cross-country runners were ineligible, buggies must stay in their lanes on the front hills, buggies may have no less than 3 and no more than 5 wheels, and no switching of drivers.  But a few of the specific rules changed slightly, or are worth noting again: All drivers, pushers, designers and builders were required to members of the organization they’re competing for All team members (including designers and builders) must be “eligible” under the Executive Board’s requirements, which include a minimum of 36 units and being in good academic standing (with a minimum GPA requirement). The buggy/driver combo must weigh a minimum of 180 pounds (up from the previous 160 lbs) Teams in the outside lane are given a 3 yard head start due to being required to go the long way around the traffic dummy Each pusher must have at least 1 hand on the buggy at all times, except in the transition zone; but no more than 1 pusher may be in contact with the buggy at any time In addition to the driver, pushers, and alternates, Rosters also included all designers and builders Buggies entered in Design Comp must also finish the race in order to qualify (but exceptions are permitted) Tau Delta Phi Tries To Make Its Debut; PhiKap Struggles.  Tau Delta Phi put together a buggy with a bubbled canopy for its first try on the course.  Unfortunately, they broke their rear wheel axle (presumably during practice) and were unable to compete on Raceday. On another note, PhiKap lent their buggy to the PhiKap chapter of Pitt for Pitt’s buggy race. Unfortunately, the buggy didn’t have a very good year, as it lost the Pitt race and didn’t qualify for Finals at CMU. Beta Defeats PiKA in Design.  Beta’s new design was the winner of the first post-war Design Competition.  The buggy, designed by Rick Saxton, was shaped like a bug with welded tubular steel.  The real design battle seemed to be between Beta and PiKA, and the Tartan noted that PiKA’s buggy had a better appearance.  However, Beta’s was structurally superior and that allowed it to take home the design trophy.  1946 – PiKA’s Buggy (from the 1947 Thistle). It didn’t win Design Competition, but it had the best aesthetic design. Prelim Heats and Results.  The Prelims were run in 3 heats, with 3 teams in each. The rules initially stated that the winner of each heat would compete in the finals, but it seems that the rules changed to be the three fastest times instead, as the Prelim results printed in the May 7, 1946 Tartan indicate that the Finals was just a rematch of Prelim Heat 1.  According to the May 7 Tartan, Heat 1 saw a very tight race between KapSig, DTD, and PiKA, with KapSig winning in 3:24.5, DTD finishing in 3:25.1, and PiKA finishing in 3:26.3.  Those were the top 3 times and they advanced to the finals.  Prelim Heat 2 paired Beta, SAE, and DU, and SAE won the heat by default, as Beta was DQ’d for a pushbar violation and DU was DQ’d for a Hill 4-5 transition violation (the Tartan reports that they “shoved the buggy into the last zone instead of pushing it”).  Prelims Heat 3 was a battle between PhiKap, Theta Xi, and Scobell House (Men’s Dorms), but again, Theta Xi won by default, as both PhiKap and Scobell were DQ’d for a Hill 4-5 transition violation (the same problem that DU had). Rain or Shine, But Not Really… One other rule stated that the race would be rain-or-shine.  However, that didn’t turn out to be true.  The Finals, initially scheduled for 2pm on Saturday, May 4, were ultimately postponed until Saturday, May 11, due to a downpour that cast a damper on an otherwise exciting Spring Carnival. Controversial Finals.  An overcast sky threatened rain on the makeup date as well, though it held off long enough for the race to be run.  But some of the spectators may have wished the rain came sooner.  Although signs were posted about the makeup date, cars ignored the notices and ended up blocking part of the front hills, causing more congestion for spectators on those hills. A police tow truck was present, but it was not permitted to clear the street.  Up the front hills, DTD was in the lead, followed by PiKA and KapSig.  DTD went into the freerolls first, but the drama was behind them.  As PiKA entered the freeroll, PiKA’s buggy crowded KapSig’s buggy and forced KapSig wide, causing KapSig to swerve and hit at least 1 spectator (the Tartan says that KapSig “got out pencil and paper to try to figure out how many pedestrians they had hit”).  The impact was severe enough that KapSig’s buggy was dented, and the time it lost from the impact made it impossible for them to catch up. PiKA eventually passed DTD in the freeroll and went on to win by 30 yards, but by then it didn’t matter.  The judges decided to DQ PiKA for interference.  The brothers of PiKA didn’t take it lightly though; they immediately lodged a protest against the judge’s decision.  After an hour-long argument with the judges (and presumably the Sweepstakes committee), the decision to DQ PiKA was upheld and DTD was awarded the victory. Final Time. The Tartan reported that DTD’s winning time was 3:49, but our database has the time as 2:49. 3:49 would be significantly slower than any other race on this course, but I also think it’s possible. Bleak skies threatened the race (meaning it may have been bad weather), the best Prelim time was 3:24.5, and DTD was the 2nd buggy to cross the finish line in the Finals. So is it possible that DTD rolled 35 seconds faster during the Finals? Sure. But I think I buy that they were 25 seconds slower a little more. 1947 Raceday: Prelims on Friday, May 2 at 1:00pm; Finals on Saturday, May 3 at 2:30pm  Sweepstakes Committee: Robert Kerr (Chair)  Race Results: (1) DU; (2) PiKA; (3) DTD  Design Comp: (1) PiKA  Weather: Overcast turning to Rain on Friday; Drizzle on Saturday; High of 65/63, Low of 52/49  For the second year in a row, we had another controversial Finals involving PiKA (but thanks to limited info in the Tartan, we’re missing some juicy details). But this time it earned one fraternity, with their unique buggy/driver combo, their first and only winning trophy.  Fight Over Carnival Schedule.  Now that Spring Carnival was back on, the students had to decide how they wanted it – As 2 days in May (losing a day of vacation) or one day in April (not sacrificing any other off days).  Buggy was going to happen either way, but ultimately the students voted on a 2 day Carnival, keeping the tradition intact and putting Raceday on the schedule for May 2-3. Time Trials.  It looks like this post-war period was when the race changed from a head-to-head to a time trial.  1946 was the first clue, since the 3 buggies advancing to the Finals were from the same Prelim Heat.  But in 1947, it became more obvious, as there were 4 Prelim Heats but only the 3 teams with the fastest Prelim times advanced to the Finals. Prelims.  Sadly, the 1947 Tartan was not very interested in Buggy, so we don’t know much about the race.  In fact, all we really know from the Tartan is that PhiKap’s buggy was built by DeBolt, Malenock, Butters, and Gregg, and was driven by Danny Gallo.  But thanks to the 1948 Thistle, we know that DTD, DU, and PiKA had the top 3 times from the Prelims and advanced to the Finals.  We also know that storms moved in right after the Prelims on Friday, creating some concern about whether the Finals would run as scheduled. ANOTHER Controversial Finals. For the second year in a row, there was a major controversy during the finals.  Unfortunately, this time we don’t actually know what the controversy was.  According to the CIT Alumnus from May, the finals were “undecided”, and per the 1948 Thistle, the race ended in protest.  But whatever happened seemed to be between PiKA and DU, because the two of them were granted a reroll to determine the winner.  And in that reroll, DU’s “Flying Pork Barrel” buggy, with cowboy hat-wearing driver, crossed the finish line first, earning the victory.  DTD apparently came in 3rd, finishing in a time of 3:00. If you know anything about this protest (or anything else that we’re missing), let us know! We’ll come back and update this (and any other articles in the series) if we get additional information.  1947 – DU’s Champion Buggy, the “Flying Pork Barrel”, won a Reroll following a protested Finals (from the 1948 Thistle). 1947 Photos. Here are some photos from 1947. Some of the buggies are unidentified, so if you can ID those, let us know and we’ll update the captions.  1947 – DU’s Flying Pork Barrel (with cowboy hat-adorning driver) being pushed on the Back Hills (from the 1948 Thistle). DU would go on to earn their first and only Buggy championship. The three wheeled buggy trailing appears to be DTD. This might be the Finals.  1947 – KapSig’s Buggy (from the 1948 Thistle)  1947 – PiKA’s buggy (from the 1948 Thistle).  1947 – SigNu buggy, driven by Keith Thomas (photo from the BAA Gallery, submitted by Michael Serebrennikov)  1947 – Starting Line of a Prelims Heat (from the 1948 Thistle). Unknown buggy in Lane 1, Theta Xi in Lane 2, and an unknown (barely visible) buggy in Lane 3.  1947 – Prelim (Unknown Heat) Back Hills (from the 1948 Thistle). Beta’s snow plow buggy (with dragon) leading (far left), KapSig 2nd (far right), SigNu trailing (middle)  Who wore it best? 1947 – DU and DTD on Hill 1 during what we now believe might be the Finals (from the 1948 Thistle).  1947 – KapSig being pushed on the back hills (unknown buggy trailing) (from the 1948 Thistle). 1948 Raceday: Prelims on Friday, May 14 at 1:00pm; Finals on Saturday, May 15 at 1:00pm  Sweepstakes Committee: Robert Kerr (Chair)  Race Results: (1) DTD (2:48); (2) KapSig (~2:48.5); (3) PiKA  Design Comp: (1) KapSig  Weather: Sunny; High of 62/72, Low of 54/50  1948 saw the first independent orgs and the start of DTD’s run of greatness, but it wasn’t easy, as they barely held off KapSig for the championship.  First Non-Greek Orgs.  14 Organizations were entered for Raceday in 1948.  They included all 12 fraternities (ATO, Beta, Beta Sigma Rho, DTD, DU, KapSig, PhiKap, PiKA, SAE, SigNu, Tau Delta Phi, and Theta Xi), the Men’s Dorms, and Citcom Clan (the commuters – “Citcom” is short for “CIT Commuter”).  Although the Men’s Dorms were permitted to enter as far back as 1928, this is the first year that we have evidence that any organization other than a Greek actually did so. Training started in April, and the organizations snuck out at midnight to get some practice on the course. Avoiding Controversies.  After the controversy of 1947 (which, sadly and as noted above, we don’t have details of), Sweepstakes decided to tighten up the rules to avoid any confusion for Raceday.  Of course, we don’t have the rules that were tightened either.  We’ll keep digging, and if we find it out, we’ll update this post.  On the plus side, 1948 didn’t appear to have any controversies. Prelim Results.  Raceday itself was pretty uneventful, which leads to a boring story.  Prelims were run in 5 heats, with DTD, KapSig, and PiKA advancing to the Finals (DTD put up a Prelim time of 2:51).  There were no crashes.  In fact, the only thing of note that we know about is that Beta Sigma Rho was DQ’d for a pushbar violation (the DQ was not protested, as their time wasn’t fast enough to make the Finals anyway). Finals.  The Finals was a very tight race (see photo right).  We don’t have many details of the race itself, but DTD took the win, just barely edging out KapSig, who was less than 1 second behind.  DTD’s goggled driver was Dick Stanley, and the Hill 5 pusher working very hard was Barry Rowles.  As a consolation prize, KapSig’s streamlined aluminum buggy (which looks just like a slightly larger version of today’s designs, with an extra wheel) took home the Design Comp trophy.  1948 – Barry Rowles (DTD Hill 5) works hard to get DTD (left) across the finish line first, edging out KapSig (right) for the trophy (from the 1949 Thistle). First “Broadcast”.  1948 is the first indication that we have of a “broadcast” on Raceday.  According to the May 18, 1948 Tartan, a jeep patrolled the course and carried both the starter and a PA system, allowing the occupants of the vehicle to broadcast the race to the spectators on the course (as long as you were in range to hear the PA system). 1948 Photos. Here are some photos from 1948. Let us know if you can ID any of the “unknown” buggies.  1948 – Design Competition (from the 1949 Thistle). Identified buggies: KapSig (3rd from the left, back row); PiKA (4th from the left, back row); Beta Sigma Rho (far left, back row). We also believe that the bottom buggy in the front row (3 wheels, no shell) belongs to Citcom Clan.  1948 – Hill 1 of the Finals (from the 1949 Thistle). KapSig in Lane 1 (left), DTD in Lane 2 (middle), PiKA in Lane 3 (right)  1948 – Another angle of the neck-and-neck finish of the Finals (from the 05-18-1948 Tartan). DTD, on the left, won the race, with KapSig, on the right, less than 1 second behind.  1948 – DTD’s winning buggy (from the 1949 Thistle).  1948 – KapSig’s buggy at a Back Hills transition (from the 1949 Thistle).  1948 – DTD’s winning buggy (photo from the BAA Archives, courtesy of Amy Bluma) 1949 Raceday: Prelims on Friday, May 13 at 10:30am; Finals on Saturday, May 14 at 1:00pm  Sweepstakes Committee: Jack Johnson (Chair)  Race Results: (1) DTD (2:42.5 – COURSE RECORD); (2) PiKA (2:43.5); (3) KapSig  Design Comp: (1) SAE; (Honorable Mention) PiKA  Weather: Sunny; 66-72 Degrees on Friday, 70-75 Degrees on Saturday  In 1949, DTD earned its second straight nose-length victory and set a course record in doing so. Other than that, the year seemed uneventful.  Déjà vu.  Much like the prior years, the Tartan didn’t seem too interested with Buggy in 1949.  So what we know is that 1949 seems very similar to 1948.  Once again, 14 organizations (all 12 fraternities, Dorm Council and Citcom Clan) entered the race, and Prelims were run in 5 heats.  The first 4 Heats had 3 buggies each, while the 5th Heat had only 2. Record-Breaking Year.  There was little, if any, doubt that a course record would be broken this year.  And in fact, each of DTD, PiKA, and KapSig, the 3 teams qualifying for Finals, broke the post-war record.  In the finals, it was another close battle, with DTD squeaking it out over PiKA.  DTD’s winning time of 2:42.5 was fast enough to set the course record, and PiKA’s 2:43.5 was only ½ second behind the prior record. SAE’s Best Design.  SAE took home the trophy for Design Comp with their sleek aluminum buggy. Unfortunately, we haven’t found a photo. [Ed. Update: Based on the buggies from 1950, the 1950 Thistle’s actual description of SAE’s buggy as a “sleek aluminum auto”, and DTD’s letter to the editor in 1951 complaining that if a team had used a “Buick grill” they would have placed in Design Comp, we’ve determined that Buggy #4 (2nd from the left in the Design Comp photo below) is actually SAE’s design winner. For a better look at the design, check out the 1950 photos, which is a similar style (though with different wheels, a different pushbar, and likely some other changes).] 1949 Photos. Here are photos from 1949. If you can ID any of the unknown buggies, let us know.  1949 – Design Competition (from the 1966 Buggy Book). Buggies are KapSig (far left), SAE’s design winner (#4, 2nd from the left), Men’s Dorms (#7, 3rd from the left), and DU (#11, far right).  1949 – SAE’s Design-winning buggy getting worked on (from the November 1949 issue of The Record, the SAE National Publication)  1949 – Citcom Clan Buggy (#9) (from the 1950 Thistle).  1949 – KapSig’s buggy with front hatch removed, being inspected (from the 1950 Thistle).  1949 – PiKA’s Buggy and team (from the 1950 Thistle)  1949 – ATO’s buggy (from the 1950 Thistle). The buggy is flat and white, and has side view mirrors!  1949 – KapSig’s buggy being pushed on the Back Hills (from the 1949 Thistle)  1949 – PiKA’s Buggy (from the 1950 Thistle)  1949 – Buggies at the top of Hill 2 entering the freeroll (from the BAA Gallery, courtesy of the CMU Archives).
