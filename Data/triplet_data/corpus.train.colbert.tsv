13	The Machine  The basics of a buggy are straightforward, but teams are often secretive in how they build the machines, in particular the way they brake, steer and what types of wheels are used.  Each has a body, pushbar for runners to move the machine up the hills, wheels, a safety harness and driving and braking mechanisms. Some also include fairings, a type of housing around the wheels that help reduce drag, make the vehicle quieter and just looks cool.  Fairings have been a key feature for the Fringe team in recent years, which is celebrating its 50th anniversary of Buggy.  "We have a reputation of being the quietest on the course," said Diya Nuxoll, who wrapped up her bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering in December and is working on an advanced studies master's degree in design and manufacturing. Nuxoll leads the Fringe team as one of two head mechanics.  This year Fringe is planning to roll four different vehicles, built and maintained in the Fringe workshop in the basement of the East Campus Garage, known as the "Froom."  "We're used to saying everything with 'fr' in front of it but when we say something in front of other people, it gets them confused," said Fringe head mechanic Dave Singh, who will graduate in May with a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering and biomedical engineering.  Fringe vehicles often are named with the letter "B," like Boson, Blueshift, Bissa and Bumper. Other teams, such as Apex, often use names that connotate fire, while the SDC (Student Dormitory Committee) team, uses names such as Vice, Bane, Avarice and Malice.  This year's buggy names will be under wraps until Thursday, when the Buggy Showcase will take place from noon to 2 p.m. in Weigand Gymnasium in the Cohon University Center. It's one of the few times spectators can see buggies up close.

50	About Scotty  The Scottish terrier has long been a familiar figure around Carnegie Mellon's campus. For years students have suited up in an unofficial Scottish terrier costume to excite the fans at athletic events. But the relationship between the Scottish terrier breed and Carnegie Mellon far precedes anybody doing somersaults in a dog costume. Andrew Carnegie, founder of the university, kept a Scottish terrier as his pet.  Scotty's road from popular icon to official mascot of the university began in 2006. Carnegie Mellon formed a Mascot Identity Task Force in November 2006, which consisted of students, faculty, staff and alumni. The Task Force was co-chaired by Director of Athletics Susan Bassett and Dean of Student Affairs Jennifer Church.  The mascot selection process included a series of surveys and a university Town Hall meeting. Nearly 78 percent of 2,370 students surveyed in February 2007 voted for the Scottish terrier, and approximately 25 percent of 400 alumni surveyed thought the Scottish terrier was already the mascot.  In the spring, the Task Force partnered with SME Branding — a firm with more than 17 years of experience creating mascots for professional sports teams and universities — to develop the graphics for the mascot. During October, students and alumni reviewed potential mascot images in focus groups.  Carnegie Mellon's official mascot debuted at the Nov. 10, 2007 home football game. The graphic features a profile of a distinguished, bold Scottish terrier sporting a plaid scarf around his neck. The dog is contained in a shield, representing Carnegie Mellon's Scottish heritage.  The Task Force then partnered with a mascot costume company to design our Scottish terrier in the winter of 2007. The official Scotty costume was unveiled at the 2008 Spring Carnival.

60	The merger has had a significant impact on the world of higher education, research, and discovery.
61	Official Mascot? More than a century after Carnegie Mellon University opened its doors, an official mascot finally made its mark. Although students have dressed as a Scottish terrier — typically referred to as Scotty — for 50 years, it wasn't until 2007 that Carnegie Mellon officially welcomed the Scottish terrier as the university's first mascot.  In keeping with tradition, students, faculty, staff and alumni voted to name the new official mascot Scotty. But it's not just the costumed mascot that voters named. The live dog is also known as Scotty to the Carnegie Mellon community.
62	Carnegie Mellon has research partnerships in places like Los Angeles, New York City, Washington, D.C., Australia, China, Portugal, and Rwanda.

All of our programs provide the hands-on experience and rigorous curriculum that are the hallmark of computer science at Carnegie Mellon. Program Type: Master's Programs Program Name: Master of Science in Intelligent Information Systems (MIIS) Overview: The Master's in Intelligent Information Systems degree focuses on recognizing and extracting meaning from text, spoken language and video. As an MIIS student, you’ll receive the department’s deepest exposure to content analysis and machine learning. In addition to completing the program’s coursework, you’ll work on directed study projects with your faculty advisor for two semesters; participate in a summer internship; and collaborate with your peers on a semester-long, group-oriented capstone project. This combination of classroom instruction, professional experience, and using new skills in significant projects with world-class colleagues will help prepare you for a successful career in industry or government. Our alumni have gone on to exciting careers at places like Apple, IBM and Google, and most have job offers within six weeks of graduation. Requirements: The Intelligent Information Systems degree offers students the flexibility to create their own course of study in consultation with their advisor.  MIIS students gain three types of practical experience: software development supervised by their advisor (24 units equivalent to two courses); a summer internship (which can be waived for students that have sufficient prior professional experience); and a capstone project executed in a group of peers (42 units equivalent to three 12-unit courses and one 6-unit course). This combination is proven to help IIS students to broaden their skills quickly. The MIIS degree is offered in two options: Option 1. Standard MIIS degree (MIIS-16) - A 16-month track that is completed in three academic semesters (fall, spring, fall) and a summer internship.   Option 2. MIIS: Advanced Study degree (MIIS-21) - A 21-month track that is completed in four academic semesters (fall, spring, fall, spring) and a summer internship. MIIS: Advanced Study track offers indepth degree in one of the following areas of concentration: Human Language for Language Technologies Language Technology Application Machine Learning for Language Technologies Part-time education option is available in some cases.  MIIS-16 students must take at least 84 units (typically 7 courses) of qualifying and elective courses that satisfy human language, machine learning, and language technology applications breadth requirements. MIIS-21 students have to take at least two more courses from the selected concentration area to satisfy their degree requirements, making it total of 108 units (typically 9 courses) of qualifying and elective courses, that also satisfy breadth requirements.

75	25 Great Things About SCS What’s so great about computer science at Carnegie Mellon? We're glad you asked! Here are 25 great ideas from CMU computer scientists to think about as we celebrate the birthday of the School of Computer Science. 1. Artificial intelligence, 1955-56 Can you write a working computer program without a computer? Herb Simon (H’90), at left, Allen Newell (IA’57), at right, and Cliff Shaw did. The team created the first artificial intelligence program, Logic Theorist, which could solve logic puzzles in the same way that a human might solve them. Newell demonstrated that it worked by writing the instructions on 3-by-5 index cards that were manipulated on the kitchen table by Newell, his wife, and a group of Carnegie Tech grad students.  2. Multi-core processors, 1971 Multi-core processors are common in today’s computers, but they were still science fiction in the early 1970s. But when CMU researchers found their existing machines too slow to keep pace with the advance of speech and graphics programs, they knew they had to do something. They solved the problem by ganging together 16 processors to build a pioneering computer called C.mmp—then topped the feat by linking 50 processors into Cm*.  3. Tutoring machines, 1973 Games and drills, such as flash cards, have long been used to help students learn tough subjects. But the cognitive tutoring programs developed at Carnegie Mellon, beginning in the 1970s, did more than simply drill students on math problems. Cognitive tutors were able to adapt, presenting harder or easier problems as students learned or stumbled. Today, cognitive tutors teach subjects such as algebra to hundreds of thousands of students every year.  4. Speech recognition, 1976 If you have an iPhone, ask Siri to look up “Hearsay I,” the first computer system capable of continuous speech recognition. It was developed by future Turing Award winner and future SCS dean Raj Reddy along with his students. Their work on subsequent systems established many of the principles that still underlie speech recognition software.  5. Emoticons, 1982 Sure, it was just a joke, but (for better or worse) it’s endured for more than three decades. CMU researcher Scott Fahlman created the emoticon to clear up misunderstandings on computer message boards. We’ve been looking at the world sideways ever since. :-)  6. Andrew project, 1982 It was long the dream of computer scientists to put a workstation in every home and office, but no one had actually tried to accomplish it until researchers from Carnegie Mellon University and IBM launched the Andrew Project. Soon, every student, faculty member and employee had access to email, word processing, file-transfer services and graphics programs, and CMU was the most-wired campus in the world.  7. Autonomous robots, 1983 Thanks to Red Whittaker (E'75,'79), robots moved off of the assembly lines and into places no human ever could go. His Robotic Reconnaissance Vehicle spent four years inspecting and cleaning up the contaminated reactor building at the crippled Three Mile Island nuclear plant.  8. User interfaces, 1983 Why should humans adapt to fit computers? Shouldn’t computers adapt to fit humans? That was the attitude of CMU researchers, who applied design principles to computer science to develop better, easier-to-use interfaces. They called the new field “human-computer interaction.”  9. Machine translation, 1984 Every “Star Trek” fan knows about the universal translator. Scientists in the Language Technologies Institute are moving those gadgets from science fiction to real life. Their pioneering systems include handheld, portable speech-to-speech translators, just like those depicted on the USS Enterprise.  10. Mach kernel, 1985 In computer parlance, a “kernel” is the heart of an operating system, passing input and output requests to and from the processor. At the core of all modern Apple devices --- including iPhones, iPads and MacBooks --- is the Mach kernel, developed at CMU under the leadership of then-professor Rick Rashid.  11. Computer chess, 1990 Could a computer play chess at the level of the world’s best players? For many years, it was considered the “holy grail” of artificial intelligence. Hitech, developed by CMU researcher Hans Berliner (CS’74), was the first computer to achieve grandmaster status. CMU alumni played key roles in developing “Deep Blue,” the IBM machine that beat human chess champion Garry Kasparov in 1997.  12. Java, 1991 As a CMU grad student, James Gosling (CS’83) worked on the Andrew project, which stressed interoperability between computers, whether they were Macs, IBMs or Unix machines. Those lessons served Gosling well when he developed Java, the first programming language able to run on almost any platform.  13. Email attachments, 1992 Steve Jobs liked the email system built into CMU’s Andrew so much that he tried to hire Nathaniel Borenstein (CS’81,’85) and the rest of his team to create a similar program for Apple. Borenstein didn’t take the offer, but he did like Jobs’ idea about attaching documents to email. Borenstein went on to develop the MIME standard that’s used by all email programs to send photos and other files over the Internet.  14. Web search engines, 1994 The World Wide Web was still in its toddler stage when CMU researcher Michael “Fuzzy” Mauldin (CS’83,’89) developed one of the first successful search engines, Lycos. It was the most-visited site on the Web by 1999.  15. Model checking, 1994 CMU professor Edmund Clarke had long stressed the importance of verifying computer hardware and software through a formal problem-solving technique called “model checking.” In 1994, his arguments gained new weight with the discovery that Intel’s amazing new Pentium chip made errors on certain math problems. Clarke would go on to receive the Turing Award for his role in the development of model checking.  16. CAPTCHAs, 2000 “Spam” and malicious attacks were a growing problem on the Internet when hackers developed automated “bots” that could sign up for email and other Web services without human intervention. Luis von Ahn (CS’03,’05), Nick Hopper (CS’04), John Langford (CS’02) and CMU professor Manuel Blum invented a “Completely Automated Public Turing Test to tell Computers and Humans Apart,” or CAPTCHA, to help foil the bots. A later variation, reCAPTCHA, is helping digitize old books and newspapers.  17. Robotic video cameras, 2001 When Baltimore Ravens quarterback Trent Dilfer dropped back to pass, TV viewers of Super Bowl XXXV saw something they’d never seen before --- the motion froze and the view suddenly rotated to show Dilfer’s opposite side. CBS called it Eyevision. The synchronized system of robotic cameras and advanced image processing was the brainchild of CMU’s Takeo Kanade, one of many advances he pioneered in computer vision.  18. Self-driving vehicles, 2007 Carnegie Mellon’s early attempts at self-driving vehicles progressed slowly, creeping around Pittsburgh’s Schenley Park in the late 1990s. But they were going full-throttle by the time CMU’s self-driving SUV, named BOSS, won the 2007 DARPA Urban Challenge road race.  19. Thought reading programs, 2007 Your brain reacts in different ways, depending on what words you’re thinking about --- ways that are measurable with magnetic-resonance imaging, or MRI, machines. CMU researchers Tom Mitchell and Marcel Just are decoding those brain scans and are making progress at reading people’s thoughts.  20. Kidney donor matching, 2008 Organ transplants save lives every day, but more people could likely be saved if it was easier to match recipients with donors who are unrelated. An algorithm developed by CMU scientists is close to enabling a nationwide network that would match living kidney donors with potential recipients whom they've never met in real life.  21. RNA sequencing via videogames, 2010 Thanks to crowdsourcing, science isn’t just for scientists any more. People without formal training in molecular biology are producing new insights into genetic encoding through a videogame called EteRNA, developed by researchers at CMU and Stanford, that allows players to fold and shift RNA molecules to solve on-screen puzzles.  22. Language learning software, 2010 Learning a second language has always been challenging, but a CMU spinoff called Duolingo is proving that it doesn’t have to be expensive. Duolingo has developed language tutoring software that enables users to learn Spanish, English, Italian, German, Portuguese or French for free through its website and mobile apps. In the process, Duolingo users are helping to translate the Web.  23. Question-answering computers, 2011 Searching the Web for information is rarely as simple as asking a question in plain English. So-called “question-answering” machines moved from laboratories to TV screens when an IBM computer called “Watson” defeated two human champions on the game show “Jeopardy!” At the heart of Watson was computer architecture developed by CMU’s Eric Nyberg and his students.  24. Encrypting online information, 2012 Credit card numbers and other data used online is safer thanks to an encryption scheme developed by CMU alumna Shafi Goldwasser (S’79). She shared the 2012 Turing Award for her role in developing practical encoding schemes that are difficult to break.  25. Smart, adaptable traffic signals, 2012 Smart traffic lights developed at CMU’s Robotics Institute are saving time and energy, and cutting down on the amount of air pollution created by idling cars. First rolled out in Pittsburgh’s East Liberty neighborhood, the new signals are being studied around the country.

86	April 10, 2019  Buggy Races Keep Rolling at Carnegie Mellon  In its 99th year, the tradition is a Spring Carnival treat  By Heidi Opdyke  Sweepstakes, also known as the Buggy Races, has come a long way at Carnegie Mellon University. The slick, torpedo-like vessels carrying drivers with nerves of steel are a far cry from the two-man teams that once changed places halfway through a race and rode in everything from rain barrels with bicycle wheels to three-wheeled ash cans 99 years ago.  Today, it takes six people to maneuver the .84 -mile course around Schenley Park's Flagstaff Hill.  But while five pushers and a driver navigate the course's hills, dozens of people are needed to make a successful race happen. A year of planning goes into just over two minutes of racing.

183	A history of SCS For an expanded history of the School of Computer Science and its predecessors at CMU, read "Institutional Memories" in the Summer 2014 issue of The Link magazine. In 2014, the School of Computer Science celebrated its 25th year as a stand-alone college within Carnegie Mellon University. It was arguably the first college devoted solely to computer science in the United States, and a model for others that followed. But CMU’s computer science era begins much earlier—in 1956, with the arrival of an IBM 650 computer on the campus of what was then known as Carnegie Institute of Technology. The IBM 650 had magnetic-drum memory and a processing speed of approximately 60 instructions per second. Herb Simon (H’90), associate dean of the Graduate School of Industrial Administration—now known as CMU’s Tepper School of Business—established Carnegie Tech’s first Computation Center with the help of its first director, Alan Perlis (S’42).  First freshman-level computer science course In 1956 and 1957, Simon, Allen Newell (IA’57) and Cliff Shaw of RAND designed the Logic Theorist, a computer program that could develop proofs for theorems in much the same way a human would work. They also developed linked-list data structures, the foundation of computer programming. Perlis, Simon and Newell are credited with defining the term “computer science” as “the theory and design of computers,” as well as (in Newell’s words) “the study of the phenomena arising from them.” In 1958, Perlis began teaching the first freshman-level computer programming course in the United States at Carnegie Tech.  Computer science Ph.D. program created In 1961, the Computation Center and its newest computer, a Bendix G-20, were moved to recently completed Scaife Hall. That same year, Carnegie Tech created an interdisciplinary Ph.D. program called Systems and Communications Sciences, combining elements of computer science, mathematics, psychology, business and electrical engineering. The university’s first computer science Ph.D.s were graduates of this program.  Computer Science Department established In 1965, Carnegie Tech established its Computer Science Department, or CSD, with a $5 million grant from the R.K. Mellon Foundation. Perlis was the first department head. There were no undergraduates; only Ph.D. students were admitted, and the department’s focus was on research, much of it funded by the federal government through the Defense Department’s Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA. In 1967, Carnegie Institute of Technology merged with the nearby Mellon Institute of Industrial Research to form Carnegie-Mellon University. The Department of Computer Science moved into the newly created Mellon Institute of Science, later renamed Mellon College of Science, or MCS. Future SCS dean Raj Reddy joined the CSD in 1969 after three years as an assistant professor at Stanford. He brought with him research in speech, language and computer vision. But in 1970 and 1971, the new Computer Science Department faced its first crisis, as half of its tenured faculty members—including department head Perlis—left for other universities. Joe Traub was recruited from Bell Labs to CMU to become the new department head.  Multi-processor machines emerge CSD emerged from the brief crisis as a highly agile, interdisciplinary entity, with many new faculty members taking joint appointments with other CMU departments. Several large projects emerged in the Computer Science Department, including C.mmp, the first shared-memory multiprocessor computer, with 16 processing units, and Cm*, a 50-processor computer. These computers were the forerunners of today’s ubiquitous multi-core desktops and laptops.  Turing Awards and a Nobel Prize In 1975, Simon and Newell were awarded the A.M. Turing Award for their work in artificial intelligence. (As of 2014, 12 CMU alumni or faculty have been awarded Turings, sometimes considered the Nobel Prize of computing.) Three years later, Simon received the Nobel Prize in Economics for his work on decision-making theory. As the 1970s progressed, Newell became interested in human-computer interaction, and began a long relationship with Xerox’s Palo Alto Research Center, or PARC, which released the Xerox Alto in 1973. Considered a forerunner to many of the computing environments that followed, Alto featured a graphical-user interface and was among the first commercially available workstations controlled with a mouse. Inspired by Alto, Reddy launched a drive for development of CMU’s own “three-M” machine—a personal workstation with a megabyte of memory, a megapixel display and at least one million instructions per second of processing power.  Launching a Robotics Institute In 1979, an executive at Pittsburgh’s Westinghouse Electric Corp., Tom Murrin, collaborated with Jordan and Reddy to create the Robotics Institute, with Reddy as its first director. By 1982, the Computer Science Department included more than 30 faculty members and 100 graduate students.  The best-wired campus in the world Working with IBM in the early 1980s, the university and the Computer Science Department established another new research frontier: Development of a high-speed computer network that would reach virtually every room on campus, along with a GUI-based computing environment, and providing networked PCs or workstations for 7,000 students, faculty members and employees. Called the Andrew Project, it turned Carnegie Mellon into the best-connected, most-wired university in the world—a process Newell called “greening up the campus with computer science.” CMU also became home to a new Software Engineering Institute, funded by the Defense Department, to study computer security and develop best practices in the design of operating systems. Between 1982 and 1985, the amount of sponsored research in the Computer Science Department doubled, from $7.2 million to $15.3 million—more than the other four departments in the Mellon College of Science combined.  A “school of computer science” is proposed Feeling that CSD’s needs were inadequately represented in MCS, CSD head A. Nico Habermann and then-CMU provost Angel Jordan in 1986 wrote a white paper proposing the creation of “a School of Computer Science.” Responding to concerns from the faculty that the change might be taking place too quickly, the university first established a free-floating Department of Computer Science. The experiment, which lasted two years, was an unqualified success. Separately, and also in 1986, the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center was created as a joint effort between CMU, the University of Pittsburgh and Westinghouse Electric Corp.  SCS is officially formed CMU’s Faculty Senate in the fall of 1988 agreed to President Richard Cyert’s plan to elevate the Department of Computer Science to college status. In addition to the Computer Science Department, SCS also incorporated the Robotics Institute, the Center for Machine Translation, and researchers from the Information Technology Center, which had developed Andrew. On Dec. 13, 1988, Cyert (H’89) told faculty and staff that Habermann had been appointed CMU’s first Dean of Computer Science, effective Dec. 1, and that the School of Computer Science would soon begin operations. SCS made its formal debut on Dec. 22, 1988, with a reception in the Wherrett Room of Skibo Hall, CMU’s student union. The official announcement of CMU’s new “graduate School of Computer Science” was made Jan. 3, 1989.  Undergraduate degrees begin For several years, undergraduates interested in computer science pursued an “applied math/CS” bachelor’s degree offered by the Mathematics Department. CSD professor Mary Shaw (CS’72) led CMU’s first effort to design an undergraduate curriculum solely in computer science. She and her colleagues were guided by the Carnegie Plan—guidelines established in 1938 under Carnegie Tech President Robert Doherty (A’40, E’48, H’50), outlining the principles of a sound professional education. Drawing on Shaw’s plan and also on the work of other faculty members, an undergraduate program in computer science was created during the 1989-90 academic year. Seven CS majors were admitted to the program as sophomores. Another 73 undergraduates were admitted in 1990–91. By 1995, there were 401 undergraduates in the School of Computer Science; in fall 2013, more than 600 undergraduates made up about 37 percent of student enrollment at SCS, along with more than 600 master’s degree students.  New departments, new areas of study Along the way, the Center for Machine Translation became the Language Technologies Institute, and other new departments were formed, including the Human-Computer Interaction Institute (1993), the Institute for Software Research (1999), the Machine Learning Department (2006) and the Ray and Stephanie Lane Center for Computational Biology (2009). SCS’s seven degree-granting departments draw faculty and students from a wide variety of disciplines, including engineering, mathematics, social sciences, linguistics and design.  Committed to extending our founders’ vision The School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University enters its second quarter century as a world-leading educational and research institution, embracing all facets of computing. Its graduate programs are consisted ranked with the best in the world by a leading U.S. magazine, while its undergraduate programs are also rated the best in the U.S. by corporate recruiters. In 2013, SCS had 284 faculty members and a total student enrollment of nearly 1,700, including undergraduate, master’s and Ph.D. students, and conducted $124 million in research. Indeed, by itself, the Robotics Institute is the largest university robotics research group in the world, with more than 500 people and more than 100 ongoing research projects. A half-century ago, Perlis, Simon and Newell outlined a vision for computer science. The School of Computer Science at CMU remains committed to continuing and extending their vision in the context of big data and connected computing in the 21st century.

192	Carnegie Tech – Early Years   Soon faced with the demand for baccalaureate programs, Carnegie Technical Schools began offering bachelor's degrees through its College of Engineering and College of Fine Arts, becoming the Carnegie Institute of Technology, or "Carnegie Tech." During the first half of the 20th century, with support from Andrew Carnegie and other funders, Carnegie Tech laid the foundation for a school on the cutting edge. Some key developments were:  It expanded from two buildings into an elegant 20th century campus designed in the beaux arts architectural style, housing a wealth of machine shops, studios and laboratories — the hands-on center of learning that persists today. It pioneered conservatory degree programs in music and drama, in addition to visual art and design programs. The first U.S. drama degree was awarded in 1914 at Carnegie Tech. It began offering graduate degrees. In 1919, the first doctorate (in civil engineering) was awarded to Mao Yisheng, a student from China. It laid the groundwork for a research institution, recruiting leading scientists, offering sponsored fellowships with government and industry leaders and pioneering nontraditional interdisciplinary research, which brought together physicists, chemists and metallurgists, for example. Interdisciplinary research would become the hallmark of Carnegie Mellon research. It initiated the 'Carnegie Plan' in 1938, a new curriculum that required science and engineer students to take courses in humanities and social sciences in order to better understand the needs of society. Carnegie died in 1919, but his vision for an educated public lived on after him.

214	Learn at LTI The LTI's degree programs draw from a common set of courses and core skills, but emphasize different types of expertise that prepare you for a wide range of career options. All of our programs provide the hands-on experience and rigorous curriculum that are the hallmark of computer science at Carnegie Mellon. Program Type: Master's Programs Program Name: Master of Computational Data Science (MCDS) Overview: The MCDS degree focuses on engineering and deploying large-scale information systems. Our comprehensive curriculum equips you with the skills and knowledge to develop the layers of technology involved in the next generation of massive information system deployments and analyze the data these systems generate. When you graduate, you’ll have a unified vision of these systems from your core courses; internship experience; and semester-long, group-oriented capstone project. MCDS graduates are sought-after software engineers, data scientists and project managers at leading information technology, software services and social media companies. Requirements: The MCDS program offers three majors: Systems, Analytics, and Human-Centered Data Science. All three require the same total number of course credits, split among required core courses, electives, data science seminar and capstone courses specifically defined for each major. The degree can also be earned in two different ways, depending on the length of time you spend working on it. Regardless of the timing option, all MCDS students must complete a minimum of 144 units to graduate. Here are the options: Standard Timing — a 16-month degree consisting of study for fall and spring semesters, a summer internship, and fall semester of study. Each semester comprises a minimum of 48 units. This timing is typical for most students. Students graduate in December. Extended Timing — a 20-month degree consisting of study for fall and spring semesters, a summer internship, and a second year of fall and spring study. Each semester comprises a minimum of 36 units. Students graduate in May. For a complete overview of the MCDS requirements, visit the MCDS website or read the MCDS Handbook. Curriculum: To earn an MCDS degree, student must pass courses in the core curriculum, the MCDS seminar, a concentration area and electives. Students must also complete a capstone project in which they work on a research project at CMU or on an industry-sponsored project. In total, students must complete 144 eligible units of study, including eight 12-unit courses, two 12-unit seminar courses and one 24-unit capstone course. Students must choose at minimum five core courses. The remainder of the 12-unit courses with course numbers 600 or greater can be electives chosen from the SCS course catalog. Any additional non-prerequisite units taken beyond the 144 units are also considered electives. MCDS students must also pass the undergraduate course 15-513 Introduction to Computer Systems (6 units), typically in the summer before their program commences. The student must pass with a grade of B- or better. Failure to pass the course means that the student takes 15-213 during either the fall or spring semester. Note that in both cases the units do not count toward the 144 eligible units of study. Click here to see the MCDS Course Map. Some example courses of study are included below.

He turned his attention to writing, social activism and philanthropy, determined to establish educational opportunities for the general public where few existed. In 1900, he donated $1 million for the creation of a technical institute for the city of Pittsburgh, envisioning a school where working-class men and women of Pittsburgh could learn practical skills, trades and crafts that would enhance their careers, lives and communities. "My heart is in the work," he stated, which would become part of the school's official motto. The Carnegie Technical Schools offered two- and three-year certificates in the arts as well as in engineering disciplines and included a college for women, Margaret Morrison Carnegie College.

222	So what's the difference between tartan and plaid?  You'll know it's a tartan if... • "It's a check or pattern in a variety of colours in woven fabric in which bands of colour are repeated in equal proportion in warp (running lengthwise) and weft (running across)." • "Each stripe of the warp crosses every stripe of the weft, so when vertical and horizontal stripes of the same color cross, the result is solid color at the point of intersection." • "The arrangement of colored threads is the same in the warp as in the weft."  You can find our official tartan on various items in the University Store.  Source: "Tartan: Romancing the Plaid," by Jeffrey Banks and Doria De La Chapelle

325	Behind the Wheel  Drivers, have the closest connection to the vehicles, aside from the mechanics who spent countless hours building and maintaining individual buggies. While races are brief, each driver must log a number of practice runs to qualify to race. Teams practice nights and weekends throughout the fall and spring semesters as weather permits. Buggies are often built around drivers, so the fit can be snug, and drivers are often less than 5 feet, 3 inches in height. Most — but not all — are women.  Tishya Girdhar, a junior in neuroscience, is social chair for Fringe. She came to CMU wanting to drive, but first she had to get over being claustrophobic. She started as a mechanic and got behind the wheel for last year's Sweepstakes.  "Our team's philosophy is to teach everyone how to do everything," Girdhar said. "But I came to CMU wanting to drive. I wanted to drive so badly."  Safety is a top priority for teams. All drivers are required to have five pieces of safety gear: mouth guard, goggles, a harness that includes three points of contact to the body of the buggy, gloves and a helmet. And during practice runs and races, flaggers man the course to let drivers know if it's safe to proceed.  The streets of the race course haven't changed, but the condition of the course varies due to potholes, which can make or break a fast run. The last course records were set in 2017, but this year potholes are making for some challenging conditions, said Amy Chen, a senior in psychology who has been driving for four years.  With the vehicles just inches from the ground, "even poorly filled potholes makes it dangerous to drive," she added.  Depending on Friday and Saturday's conditions, most heats may run just two lanes instead of three. But still, despite some of the challenges, Chen said she wouldn't miss it.  "Being a driver is really fun," Chen said. "I love going fast and going around the course."

328	What is a Tartan?  The Carnegie Mellon athletic teams are nicknamed the "Tartans" as a nod to Andrew Carnegie's Scottish heritage. A tartan is often misrepresented as a fierce warrior from either the Asian tundra or Scottish highlands. In actuality, a Tartan is a twilled woolen fabric with a plaid design. It is of Scottish origin and consists of stripes of various colors and widths against a solid ground, denoting a particular family lineage. The school's founder, Andrew Carnegie, was born in Dunfermline, Scotland, in 1835. Carnegie came to the United States in 1848 and founded Carnegie Technical Schools in Pittsburgh in 1900.  The Scottish terrier mascot performer sports Carnegie tartan attire, while the graphic mascot is wearing a plaid scarf around its neck.

336	Learn at LTI The LTI's degree programs draw from a common set of courses and core skills, but emphasize different types of expertise that prepare you for a wide range of career options. All of our programs provide the hands-on experience and rigorous curriculum that are the hallmark of computer science at Carnegie Mellon. Program Type: Master's Programs Program Name: Master of Language Technologies Overview: The MLT program prepares students for a research career in academia or industry. In this program, you’ll be immersed in research for two full years. During the academic year, your time will be evenly split between taking courses and doing research with your faculty advisor. Your summer will be devoted entirely to research. Many MLT grads continue on to Ph.D. programs at CMU and other top institutions, while others pursue careers at companies emphasizing research and rapid innovation. Requirements: The MLT program lasts two years (24 months), and students must complete two summers of research. Students should usually expect to graduate in August of their second year. MLT students take 120 or more course units (about 10 courses), at least 72 of which are LTI courses, and 24 of which are School of Computer Science (SCS) courses. Most of these are 12-unit courses, although lab courses are typically 6 units. Our courses generally assume knowledge of programming and data structures. The remaining units may also be taken from the LTI, or with approval from the faculty advisor, any other senior- or graduate-level course offered at CMU or Pitt. Directed research is another integral part of the MLT program; MLT students carry out directed research during their studies, with guidance from their faculty advisors. Students may also choose to complete an optional MLT thesis. Guidelines can be found in the MLT Handbook. Curriculum: Here's an example of how your two years in the MLT program may break down.  Year 1 Fall: - Grammars and Lexicons - Algorithms for NLP - Directed Study  Year 1 Spring: - Search Engines or Machine Learning for Text Mining - Machine Translation - Self-Paced Lab - Directed Study  Year 1 Summer: - Required Research   Year 2 Fall: - Software Engineering for LT (I) - Speech Understanding - Self-Paced Lab - Directed Study  Year 2 Spring: - Software Engineering for LT (II) - Directed Study - Elective  Year 2 Summer: - Required Research  Admission: Carnegie Mellon's School of Computer Science has a centralized online application process. Applications and all supporting documentation for fall admission to any of the LTI's graduate programs must be received by the application deadline. Incomplete applications will not be considered. The application period for Fall 2024 will open on September 6, 2023. *Please note, we no longer require mailed, hard versions of transcripts or test scores at the time of application.
