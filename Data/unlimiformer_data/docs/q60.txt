Question: What are the majors offered in the MCDS program?

Context: Mel-cepstral Distortion (MCD). We follow previous work (Hayashi et al. 2021) and use MCD to measure the reconstruction error between ground truth and synthesis, given the same text and speaker reference speech. We extract 23 mel-cepstral coefﬁcients (MCEPs) and use Euclidean distance as the metric. Dynamic Time Wraping (Giorgino 2009) is applied for the alignment. We calculate MCD using the ground truth utterances from the validation split.

The MCDS degree offers students with a Bachelor's degree the opportunity to improve their training with advanced study in Computer Science and Machine Learning. We cater to students with basic analytic skills and a
The MCDS Program offers a core curriculum and several concentrations; students entering the program enroll in core courses in their first semester and select further courses to satisfy at least one concentration (see Section 3.3.6). Students construct their own course of study, in consultation with their academic advisor, in order to satisfy broad guidelines. Thus, a student may tailor their coursework in a given concentration to follow a particular area of emphasis. The MCDS program is
