Question: What defines a tartan pattern in fabric?

Context: where Lf t/Lf t are finetuning/pretraining loss functions, Df t/Dpt are finetuning/pretraining datasets, and w(·; λ) is the data reweighting network. Following the experiment setup in TARTAN [11], we use task-specific data and a masked language modeling loss in our auxiliary task and perform experiments with RoBERTa-base on 4 datasets from the original DAPT/TAPT paper. We compare our SAMA- based data optimization against DAPT and TARTAN-MT. We exclude TAPT and TARTAN-Meta respectively because
Baselines We adopt DAPT [24] and TARTAN-MT [11] as our baselines for this experiment. In detail, DAPT [24] performs additional masked language model pretraining on domain-specific data on top of the pretrained RoBERTa-base model and then finetunes the model on the downstream text classification task. We follow [24] (see Table 14 in the original paper) for setting downstream finetuning hyperparameters. Alternatively, TARTAN-MT [11] performs masked language modeling with task specific data and
reweighting samples from the continued pretraining task with meta learning. To this end, we adopt the auxiliary learning technique from TARTAN [11] and simplify the two-stage pretraining- finetuning pipeline into a one-stage multitask learning pipeline with the reweighting scheme applied to the pretraining loss. The bilevel optimization formulation is as follows:

You'll know it's a tartan if... • "It's a check or pattern in a variety of colours in woven fabric in which bands of colour are repeated in equal proportion in warp (running lengthwise) and weft (running across)." • "Each stripe of the warp crosses every stripe of the weft, so when vertical and horizontal stripes of the same color cross, the result is solid color at the point of intersection." • "The arrangement of colored threads is the same in the warp as in the weft."
The Carnegie Mellon athletic teams are nicknamed the "Tartans" as a nod to Andrew Carnegie's Scottish heritage. A tartan is often misrepresented as a fierce warrior from either the Asian tundra or Scottish highlands. In actuality, a Tartan is a twilled woolen fabric with a plaid design. It is of Scottish origin and consists of stripes of various colors and widths against a solid ground, denoting a particular family lineage. The school's founder, Andrew Carnegie, was born in Dunfermline,
