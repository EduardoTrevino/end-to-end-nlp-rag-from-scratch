Course number: 15090
11-935 – LTI Practicum (3 units). Summer Internship  11-654 – AI Innovation (12 units). Seco nd Fall semester. Only open to MSAII.

11-699 – Capstone Project (36 units). Second Spring  semester. Only open  to MSAII.

3) The Knowledge Area Courses (72 units):

11-601, Coding Bootcamp (12 un its). First fall semester.

10-601, Machine Learning (12 units), First fall semester. (Normally

11-691, Math for Machine Learni ng, which is not being offered in Fall 2022.)
A student may not take more than 60 units per semester, without permission from their academic advisor. Students must maintain full-time enrollment status (minimum of 36 units) in their final semester. 3.3.4 Prerequisite Core Course All MCDS students are expected to pass the 11-637 Foundations of Computational Data Science course by the end of their first semester. Each student must pass 11-637 with a grade of “B” or better. 3.3.5 Plan of study The degree consists of two timing options based on
MCDS students must also pass the undergraduate course 15-513 Introduction to Computer Systems (6 units), typically in the summer before their program commences. The student must pass with a grade of B- or better. Failure to pass the course means that the student takes 15-213 during either the fall or spring semester. Note that in both cases the units do not count toward the 144 eligible units of study. Click here to see the MCDS Course Map. Some example courses of study are included below.
