Question: In the BiasX paper, how much do imperfect machine-generated explanations help in correctly identifying subtly (non-)toxic content?

Context: explanations for cor- rectly identifying subtly (non-)toxic content. The quality of explanations is critical: imper- fect machine-generated explanations (+2.4% on hard toxic examples) help less compared to expert-written human explanations (+7.2%). Our results showcase the promise of using free- text explanations to encourage more thoughtful toxicity moderation.
of varying difficulties. We explore three primary research questions: (1) When do free-text explana- tions help improve the content moderation quality, and how? (2) Is the explanation format in BIASX effective? and (3) How might the quality of the explanations affect their helpfulness? Our results show that BIASX indeed helps moderators better detect hard, subtly toxic instances, as reflected both in increased moderation performance and subjec- tive feedback. Contrasting prior work that use
BIASX improves moderation quality, especially on hard-toxic examples. Shown in Figure 2a, we find that HUMAN-EXPL leads to substantial gains in moderation accuracy over the NO-EXPL base- line on both hard-toxic (+7.2%) and hard-non-toxic examples (+7.7%), which as a result is reflected as a +4.7% accuracy improvement overall. This indi- cates that explicitly calling out statementsâ€™ implied stereotypes or prejudices does encourage content moderators to think more thoroughly about the tox- icity
could solve logic puzzles in the same way that a human might solve them. Newell demonstrated that it worked by writing the instructions on 3-by-5 index cards that were manipulated on the kitchen table by Newell, his wife, and a group of Carnegie Tech grad students.
