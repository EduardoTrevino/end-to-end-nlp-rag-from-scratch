Question: Where does the sharp right-hand turn of the buggy course occur?

Context: , where p−k(θ) ∝ pglobal(θ) pk(θ)

Unfortunately, the right-hand side of the divergence is the intractable posterior we would like to approximate in the ﬁrst place. Instead, EP solves the following problem (Eq. 3),

qnew k

(θ) = arg min

q∈Q

(cid:18)

pk(θ) q−k(θ) (cid:107) q(θ) q−k(θ)

(cid:19)

, where q−k(θ) ∝ qglobal(θ) qk(θ)

Buggy: Vehicle being raced and also a nickname for the competition.

Chute: A section of the freeroll portion of the buggy course (near the southwestern end of Frew Street at its intersection with Schenley Drive) where buggies make the sharp righthand turn from Schenley Drive onto Frew Street.

Chute Flagger: Team member who provides a signal for buggy drivers to know when to start the right-hand turn from Schenley Drive onto Frew Street.
The buggies are pushed by a team of five pushers and steered by drivers often less than 5 feet, 3 inches tall, who lay prone, strapped inside the three-wheeled carbon fiber tube. The buggy is pushed up Hills 1 and 2 of Tech Street, roll freely — up to nearly 40 miles per hour— down and around Schenley Drive to the hard, right-hand turn on Frew Street, known as the “chute.” From there, they are pushed up Hills 3, 4, and 5 to complete the 0.84-mile, or 4,418-feet course.
