Question: Which LTI prof co-authored the paper titled "AV-SUPERB: A Multi-Task Evaluation Benchmark for Audio-Visual Representation Models"?

Context: Speech processing Universal PERformance Benchmark (SU- PERB) is a leaderboard to benchmark the performance of Self- Supervised Learning (SSL) models on various speech process- ing tasks. However, SUPERB largely considers English speech in its evaluation. This paper presents multilingual SUPERB (ML-SUPERB), covering 143 languages (ranging from high- resource to endangered), and considering both automatic speech recognition and language identification. Following the concept of SUPERB, ML-SUPERB

This paper presents Dynamic-SUPERB, the ﬁrst collaborative benchmark for instruction-tuning speech models. Although previous benchmarks provide evaluations on several aspects, they are static [22–29]. In contrast, Dynamic-SUPERB encourages the commu- nity to contribute a broader range of tasks so that the task variations are dynamically extended, aiming for a more comprehensive assess- ment. For the ﬁrst version, we gathered over 20 publicly available datasets and transformed them into a

Model checking, 1994 CMU professor Edmund Clarke had long stressed the importance of verifying computer hardware and software through a formal problem-solving technique called “model checking.” In 1994, his arguments gained new weight with the discovery that Intel’s amazing new Pentium chip made errors on certain math problems. Clarke would go on to receive the Turing Award for his role in the development of model checking.
