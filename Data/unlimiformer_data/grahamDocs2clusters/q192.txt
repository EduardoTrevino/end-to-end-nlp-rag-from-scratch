3.8 Academic Integrity

In the midst of self- exploration, the high demands of a challenging academic environment can

create situations where some students have difficulty exercising good judgment. Academic

challenges can provide many opportunities for high standards to evolv e if students actively reflect

on these challenges and if the community supports discussions to aid in this process. It is the
Many Ph.D. advisors also provide access to computer clusters, cloud computing, or other resources to support computationally -intense research.

Ph.D. students are given access to the LTIâ€™s computer cluster on an as- needed basis, to be used for

course assignments, directed study projects, and/or capstone projects. The LTI cluster provides

storage and computation for projects involving large datasets and/or lengthy computation.
