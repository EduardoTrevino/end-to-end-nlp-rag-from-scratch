Question: How much does it cost to apply for the MLT program if an application is submitted a month before the deadline?

Context: receive 6 scores, and we use the average score as the final score for each response. The response with the higher final score is considered the better response. The GPT-4 evaluation incurred a cost of $20.45 for InstructBlip and $20.90 for MiniGPT-4.

Table 11: Template used to query GPT-4 for evaluating the response quality of different models.
Cost of Query Generation. For the original InPars Bonifacio et al. (2022), the cost of generation for the GPT-3 Curie model is $0.002 per one thousand tokens. The token count includes the length of the prompt and the prompting document.14 We estimate that (depending on the collection) a single generation involves 300 to 500 tokens: long-document collections Robust04 and TREC-COVID both have close to 500 tokens per generation.
In the entropy score function in Table 1, we use highest n-gram order of 2 for NLTK’s LM, we use highest n-gram order of 2 for the two halves (H K l and H K r ) and order of 5 for the sampled data (H K c ) for KenLM. Since KenLM needs at least a few words to start with, we use MLE as a warm start to select up to 5 sentences before launching KenLM. For ﬁnetuning from a M2M100 Model, training on ∼418 million parameters with Geforce RTX 3090, we use a 12-layer encoder and a 12-layer de- coder with
