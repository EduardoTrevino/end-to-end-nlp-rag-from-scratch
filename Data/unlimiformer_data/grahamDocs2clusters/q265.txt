information in different languages. In this work, we analyze the effect of this non- uniformity on the fairness of an API’s pricing policy across languages. We conduct a system- atic analysis of the cost and utility of OpenAI’s language model API on multilingual bench- marks in 22 typologically diverse languages. We show evidence that speakers of a large num- ber of the supported languages are overcharged while obtaining poorer results. These speak- ers tend to also come from regions where the

Duolingo has developed language tutoring software that enables users to learn Spanish, English, Italian, German, Portuguese or French for free through its website and mobile apps. In the process, Duolingo users are helping to translate the Web.
