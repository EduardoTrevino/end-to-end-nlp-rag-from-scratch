The contributions of this work can be summarized in three aspects. First, we introduce StyleRF, an innovative zero-shot 3D style transfer framework that can generate zero-shot high-quality 3D stylization via style transforma- tion within the feature space of a radiance ﬁeld. Second, we design sampling-invariant content transformation and deferred style transformation, the former achieving multi- view consistent transformation by eliminating dependency on holistic statistics of sampled point
