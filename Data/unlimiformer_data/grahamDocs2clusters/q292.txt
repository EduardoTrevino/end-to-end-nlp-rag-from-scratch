Question: What does FLARE stand for?

Context: FLARE is applicable to any existing LMs at inference time without additional training. Con-
long texts, where continually gathering in- formation throughout generation is essential. In this work, we provide a generalized view of ac- tive retrieval augmented generation, methods that actively decide when and what to retrieve across the course of the generation. We propose Forward-Looking Active REtrieval augmented generation (FLARE), a generic method which iteratively uses a prediction of the upcoming sentence to anticipate future content, which is then utilized as a query to retrieve
Figure 1: An illustration of forward-looking active retrieval augmented generation (FLARE). Starting with the user input x and initial retrieval results Dx, FLARE iteratively generates a temporary next sentence (shown in gray italic) and check whether it contains low-probability tokens (indicated with underline). If so (step 2 and 3), the system retrieves relevant documents and regenerates the sentence.
