Question: What percentage of CMU's Computer Science first year students in 2019 were women?

Context: Of the academics interviewed, there was an even split between early, mid, and late career (6/33% each). Of those in industry, 6 (75%) were individual contributors and 2 (25%) were research managers. Our sample is only 19% women, which is likely representative, as women comprise approximately 15% of tenure-track computer science faculty in the US (Way et al., 2016). For more discussion of the sample characteristics, see 7. Our positive response rate was 82%.

Demographic trait

% of sample
We recruited 26 researchers to participate in inter- views using purposive (Campbell et al., 2020) and snowball sampling (Parker et al., 2019): asking participants to recommend other candidates, and purposively selecting for diversity in affiliation, ca- reer stage, geographic position, and research area (see participant demographics in Appendix A.1). Our sample had a 69-31% academia-industry split, was 19% women, and 27% of participants identi- fied as part of a minoritized group in the field.
