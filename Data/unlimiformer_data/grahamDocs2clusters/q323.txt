If-needed rules are not checked until a value is explicitly requested, so adding knowledge “10:30 AM is the start time of meeting 27” and “11:30 AM is the end time of meeting 27” should not activate any triggers. The absence of any inherited triggers on {start time} and {end time} ensures this behavior. Once the value for the slot ﬁller {the duration of meeting 27} is requested, an upscan is performed on role node {duration}, which ﬁnds trigger (R C). This trigger is activated by substituting
