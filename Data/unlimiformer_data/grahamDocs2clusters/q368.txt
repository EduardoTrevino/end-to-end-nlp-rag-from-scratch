Question: What are the four stages of the MultiViz method?

Context: There were five stages of the edge detection process at the feature extraction stage. The detection techniques were Robert, Prewitt, Sobel, Canny, and Combination. They resulted in pixel value in 5×5 size (Figure 3). A 25 pixels image-shaped feature map based on the extraction pattern of multi-edge detection. Multi-edge detection had a mean of 116,333 pixels. The proposed method showed higher pixel value than others because it was the sum result of Robert, Prewitt, Sobel, and Canny. The feature
Figure 1: A high-level overview of AudioGPT. AudioGPT can be divided into four stages, including modality transformation, task analysis, model assignment, and response generation. It equips ChatGPT with audio foundation models to handle complex audio tasks and is connected with a modality transformation interface to enable spoken dialogue. We design principles to evaluate multi-modal LLMs in terms of consistency, capability, and robustness.
The SELF-ALIGN method involves four distinct stages. The first stage is called Topic-Guided Red- Teaming Self-Instruct, which employs the language model itself to generate synthetic instructions and enhance diversity via a topic-guided red-teaming approach. The second stage, Principle-Driven Self-Alignment, defines a set of principles that the AI model must adhere to and provides in-context learning demonstrations for constructing helpful, ethical, and reliable responses. The third stage,
