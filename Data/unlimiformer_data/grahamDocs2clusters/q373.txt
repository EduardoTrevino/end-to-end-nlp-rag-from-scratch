Course number: 15689
10-605, Machine Learning with Large Data sets (12 units). First spring semester.

11-611, Natural Language Processing (12 units). Second fall semester.

11-785, Deep Learning (12 unit s). Second spring semester.

One more 12-unit AI, ML or NLP course of the student’s choice (with approval of the

Program Director)

In the event that a course is not available, a course covering equivalent material with a
11-935 – LTI Practicum (3 units). Summer Internship  11-654 – AI Innovation (12 units). Seco nd Fall semester. Only open to MSAII.

11-699 – Capstone Project (36 units). Second Spring  semester. Only open  to MSAII.

3) The Knowledge Area Courses (72 units):

11-601, Coding Bootcamp (12 un its). First fall semester.

10-601, Machine Learning (12 units), First fall semester. (Normally

11-691, Math for Machine Learni ng, which is not being offered in Fall 2022.)
MCDS students must also pass the undergraduate course 15-513 Introduction to Computer Systems (6 units), typically in the summer before their program commences. The student must pass with a grade of B- or better. Failure to pass the course means that the student takes 15-213 during either the fall or spring semester. Note that in both cases the units do not count toward the 144 eligible units of study. Click here to see the MCDS Course Map. Some example courses of study are included below.
