Question: Is a valid CMU ID needed to use the tennis court?

Context: properties. But even on the lower levels, it is easy to see that Σlp ℓ , essentially because the identifier-independent certificates chosen by the first player can be used to provide each node with a new, locally unique identifier whose validity can be verified in a constant number of communication rounds. The inclusion on the nondeterministic level is strict because not-all-selected, the property of a labeled graph having at least one unselected node, lies in indΣld
proof of Remark 1, we can assign it a valid identifier without affecting the validity of the other nodes’ identifiers. Also note that we need the restriction to graphs of ∆-bounded structural degree only for ◀ the case ℓ = 0, not for the case ℓ > 0.
