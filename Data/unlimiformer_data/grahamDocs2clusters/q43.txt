Question: What language did Meloni et al (2021) achieve state-of-the-art results on for protoform reconstruction?

Context: Protoform reconstruction is the task of inferring how morphemes or words sounded in ancestral languages of a set of daughter languages. Mel- oni et al. (2021) achieved the state-of-the-art on Latin protoform reconstruction with an RNN- based encoder-decoder with attention model. We update their model with the state-of-the-art seq2seq model—the Transformer. Our model outperforms their model on a suite of differ- ent metrics on two different datasets: Meloni et al.’s Romance data of 8,000+
Meloni et al. (2021) employ a GRU-based seq2seq approach (Cho et al., 2014) to Latin proto- form reconstruction and achieve state-of-the-art character edit distances. They extend Dinu and Ciobanu (2014)’s Romance data using data from Wiktionary—for a total of 8,799 cognate sets across 5 Romance languages plus Latin—in both ortho- graphic and phonetic (IPA) representations. In their model, all entries comprising the cognate set are concatenated together in a fixed order to form a training
graffiti and other informal in- scriptions. Proto-Romance reconstructions are also not exhaustive. As a result, it is difficult to find a dataset like Meloni et al. (2021) with thousands of such ancestor forms. We are also limited to the faithfulness of espeak-ng’s Latin G2P, from which Meloni et al. (2021) obtain their phonetic Romance dataset.
