Question: When was the deadline for the MLT program applications?

Context: Looking ahead, we hope to expand this ML technique to other Breakthrough Listen datasets to further increase the impact of ML on SETI. This includes other GBT and Parkes data, as well as the upcoming MeerKAT22, Very Large Array (VLA)23, Square Kilometre Array24 and the next generation VLA (ngVLA; Ng et al., submitted) interferometric SETI projects.25

The masked language model (MLM) (Devlin et al., 2019) is used in image and video generation. To verify the tokenizer, we employ the same MLM transformers in MAGVIT (Yu et al., 2023a). As we use a smaller MLM („300M parameters) with a large codebook (218 «262K), the token factorization as discussed in Section 3.2 is applied using two heads with each predicting from a codebook of size 29.

4.3 Optional Masters’  Thesis

MLT students may optionally  elect to complete a Mast ers’ Thesis; it is not  required. Students

who intend to apply for the PhD program should consider the MLT Thesis as one of several

ways to demonstrate their research potential. Other possibilities include innovative research in a research project or class project work.

The MLT Thesis must be completed according to the following guidelines. Note in particular the October 31 proposal deadline!
