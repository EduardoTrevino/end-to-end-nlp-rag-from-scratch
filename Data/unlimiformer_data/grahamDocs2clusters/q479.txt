We evaluate both (1) intrinsic aspects of phonetic word embeddings, such as word retrieval and correlation with sound similarity, and (2) extrinsic performance on tasks such as rhyme and cognate detection and sound analogies. We hope our task suite will promote reproducibility and inspire future phonetic embedding research.
phonetic word embeddings, contain phonetic in- formation and have been of recent interest (Par- rish, 2017; Yang and Hirschberg, 2019; Hu et al., 2020; Sharma et al., 2021).1 The objective is that words with similar pronunciation should be mapped to vectors near each other in embedding space. Many tasks have benefited from incorpo- rating phonetic word embeddings, including cog- nate and loanword detection (Rama, 2016; Nath et al., 2022b,a), named entity recognition (Bharad- waj et al., 2016;
