Question: What are the two steps in the PaintSeg painting process?

Context: of the core to form the skin shape (with or without markers). This step can be done several times to increase the thickness of the skin. Based on the need of sense, we can fabricate the markers by depositing marker patterns on the core mold. Here, we manually paint red silicone on the ROSE molds at a series of holes 2 mm deep and 2 mm in diameter. After the markers were cured, we cover the mold with white silicone to create the ROSE skin. Finally, the skin was released from the core mold and
Rainfall generation can be decomposed into two steps: a calibration step and a simulation step (as shown in Fig. 2). The calibration step serves to Ô¨Ånd the set of parameters that best reproduces the statistical properties of the series given as an input or that best match the provided rainfall statistics. The simulation step takes a set of parameters as input and reproduces a time series of the process (punctual or spatial) that follows the supplied parameters. Additionally, the NEO- PRENE
Figure 1 illustrates our training procedure consisting of two steps. In Step 1, the student model is initialized from the teacher and is jointly distilled and pruned to generate a smaller model with a pre-specified size. In Step 2, the already pruned student model is further distilled to improve performance. In both steps, only unlabeled speech data are utilized and the teacher is frozen.
