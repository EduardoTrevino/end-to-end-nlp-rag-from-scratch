Context: Yangjun Zhang, Pengjie Ren, Wentao Deng, Zhumin Chen, and Maarten Rijke. 2022. Improving multi- label malevolence detection in dialogues through multi-faceted label correlation enhancement. In Pro- ceedings of the 60th Annual Meeting of the Associa- tion for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), pages 3543–3555.
To investigate and understand the voice-face correlation at a more fine-grained phoneme level, we propose an anal- ysis pipeline that leverages a common feature extractor with a regression head to predict human anthropometric measure- ments (AM) from phoneme. Specifically, Human anthropomet- ric measurements are a set of facial measurements summarized from cognitive science studies that can effectively represent the identity of a human. We decompose the audio recordings into phonemes and learn
Paper title: 'The Hidden Dance of Phonemes and Visage: Unveiling the Enigmatic Link between Phonemes and Facial Features' Published year: 2023 Publication venue or conference: Interspeech Authors: B. Raj, X. Zou, Xiang Li, Rita Singh, Yandong Wen, Liao Qu Summary: This work proposes an analysis pipeline to help explore the voice-face relationship in a fine-grained manner, i.s. phonemes v. facial anthropometric measurements (AM), and indicates that AMs are more predictable from vowels compared

4. Speech recognition, 1976 If you have an iPhone, ask Siri to look up “Hearsay I,” the first computer system capable of continuous speech recognition. It was developed by future Turing Award winner and future SCS dean Raj Reddy along with his students. Their work on subsequent systems established many of the principles that still underlie speech recognition software.
