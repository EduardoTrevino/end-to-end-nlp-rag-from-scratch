Question: What is the name of the proposed cross-modal fine-tuning framework in Graham's ICML 2023 work?

Context: Recently, some works have been proposed to ad- dress the issues of scalability and efficiency of ICL. Efforts were made to optimize prompting strate- gies with structured prompting (Hao et al., 2022b), demonstration ensembling (Khalifa et al., 2023), dynamic prompting (Zhou et al., 2023), and itera- tive forward tuning (Yang et al., 2023). Addition- ally, Li et al. (2023d) proposed EVaLM with longer context length and enhanced long-range language modeling capabilities. This model-level improve-
Our contributions:

We propose Generalized LoRA (GLoRA), a novel parameter-efficient fine-tuning frame- work. GLoRA enhances the low-rank adaptation approach with a more generalized prompt module design per layer, offering enhanced capability and flexibility in finetuning.

25. Smart, adaptable traffic signals, 2012 Smart traffic lights developed at CMU’s Robotics Institute are saving time and energy, and cutting down on the amount of air pollution created by idling cars. First rolled out in Pittsburgh’s East Liberty neighborhood, the new signals are being studied around the country.
