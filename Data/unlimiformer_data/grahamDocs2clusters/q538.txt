Question: In the KALE paper, what evaluation metrics were reported on MSMARCO?

Context: Evaluation Metrics On XQUAD, MLQA and MI-EVAL, we follow Liu et al. (2023) and Wang et al. (2023a) to use ChatGPT for generation quality evaluation. On XQUAD, MLQA, we also report exact-matching results in Appendix D. For translation tasks, we use COMET (Rei et al., 2020), BLEURT (Sellam et al., 2020) and sentence-piece BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) as metrics7. More evaluation details can be referred to Appendix D.

5 MAIN RESULTS

5.1 RESULTS ON CROSS-LINGUAL INSTRUCTION-TUNING
Table 2: Ablation study of FiT5. The evaluation metric is MRR@10 on MS MARCO and NDCG@10 on TREC DL.

Model All layers (l = 1) Top-6 layers (l = 7) Top-3 layers (l = 10) Top-2 layers (l = 11) Top-1 layer (l = 12) No global attention

FiT5 (w/o feature) 41.23 42.49 42.79 42.95 42.78 41.49

FiT5 40.83 43.36 43.93 43.43 43.07 40.95

5.1 Overall Performance
Existing evaluation approaches The most common evaluation metrics are token-matching methods such as BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002), adopted from natural language processing. These metrics are based on counting overlapping n- grams in the generated code and the reference code. CrystalBLEU (Eghbali and Pradel, 2022) extends BLEU by ignoring the 500 most oc- curring n-grams, arguing that they are trivially shared between the prediction and the reference. Nonetheless, both BLEU and CrystalBLEU rely
because they explain the program sequence, it s Core and Knowledge co urses requirements and

how students will meet the program learning outcomes.

10.7 End of Semester Evaluation

The MSAII program conducts an academic progress re view at the conclusion of each semester in

order to monitor individual student progress towa rds graduation. Should a studentâ€™s effort fall

below the acceptable level of academic perfor mance and/or fail to meet the standards

After each academic progress revi ew, a student may receive one or  more letters, indicating the

result of the review. See Section 3.1, Co urse Grade and GPA Requirements, above.

At the end of the semester, the faculty evaluate s each student's academic progress. If a student

seems to be having trouble, th e faculty determines whether it believes that the student can
