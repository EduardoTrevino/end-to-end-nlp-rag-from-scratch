Question: What are the four categories of low-level acoustic descriptors used in the TAP loss?

Context: where Lf t/Lf t are finetuning/pretraining loss functions, Df t/Dpt are finetuning/pretraining datasets, and w(·; λ) is the data reweighting network. Following the experiment setup in TARTAN [11], we use task-specific data and a masked language modeling loss in our auxiliary task and perform experiments with RoBERTa-base on 4 datasets from the original DAPT/TAPT paper. We compare our SAMA- based data optimization against DAPT and TARTAN-MT. We exclude TAPT and TARTAN-Meta respectively because
(1) TAPT consistently underperforms TARTAN-MT [9] and (2) TARTAN-Meta uses additional validation data in the meta level of the downstream tasks, making the comparison unfair. We report our experiment results in Table 3.
