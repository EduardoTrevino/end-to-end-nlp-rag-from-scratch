Question: On which benchmarks did the authors test FiT5's performance?

Context: Experimental results on widely-used IR bench- marks, namely MS MARCO (Nguyen et al., 2016) and TREC DL 2019 (Craswell et al., 2020) & 2020 (Craswell et al., 2021), demonstrate that FiT5 exhibits substantial improvements over traditional retrieve-and-rerank pipelines. Furthermore, FiT5 outperforms systems with more re-ranking stages and/or larger models on the MS MARCO dataset. Further analysis reveals that FiT5 effectively lever- ages ranking features through its global attention architecture,
Baselines We compare FiT5 with typical two- stage retrieve-and-rerank pipelines including BERT Re-ranker (Nogueira and Cho, 2019) and monoT5 (Nogueira et al., 2020). These re-rankers simply assign a score for a (q, di) text pair. To have a fair comparison, the first-stage retrieval for such pipelines is kept the same as FiT5. We also report the performance of three-stage ranking pipelines HLATR (Zhang et al., 2022) and Expando-Mono- Duo (Pradeep et al., 2021) for reference.
Table 2: Ablation study of FiT5. The evaluation metric is MRR@10 on MS MARCO and NDCG@10 on TREC DL.

Model All layers (l = 1) Top-6 layers (l = 7) Top-3 layers (l = 10) Top-2 layers (l = 11) Top-1 layer (l = 12) No global attention

FiT5 40.83 43.36 43.93 43.43 43.07 40.95

5.1 Overall Performance
8. User interfaces, 1983 Why should humans adapt to fit computers? Shouldn’t computers adapt to fit humans? That was the attitude of CMU researchers, who applied design principles to computer science to develop better, easier-to-use interfaces. They called the new field “human-computer interaction.”
15. Model checking, 1994 CMU professor Edmund Clarke had long stressed the importance of verifying computer hardware and software through a formal problem-solving technique called “model checking.” In 1994, his arguments gained new weight with the discovery that Intel’s amazing new Pentium chip made errors on certain math problems. Clarke would go on to receive the Turing Award for his role in the development of model checking.
