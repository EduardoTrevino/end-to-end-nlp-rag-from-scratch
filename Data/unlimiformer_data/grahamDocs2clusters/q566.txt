Question: Who is ther first author of the paper Cross-Modal Fine-Tuning: Align then Refine?

Context: Starting from the LLaMA-2-70b base language model (Touvron et al., 2023b), Dromedary-2 is first Supervised Fine-Tuned (SFT) with the bootstrapping data generated by an improved version4 of SELF-ALIGN with 6 In-Context Learning exemplars (Sun et al., 2023b). Following this, a Rein- forcement Learning (RL) fine-tuning stage is conducted employing the SALMON paradigm. Our endeavor aims at advancing the frontier of AI alignment when minimizing the requisite for human oversight. In this work, the
Paper title: 'One-for-All: Generalized LoRA for Parameter-Efficient Fine-tuning' Published year: 2023 Publication venue or conference: arXiv.org Authors: Eric P. Xing, Arnav Chavan, Zhuang Liu, Zhiqiang Shen, D. Gupta Summary: Generalized LoRA is presented, an advanced approach for universal parameter-efficient fine-tuning tasks, which outperforms all previous methods in natural, specialized, and structured vision benchmarks, achieving superior accuracy with fewer parameters and computations.

Those lessons served Gosling well when he developed Java, the first programming language able to run on almost any platform.
