ABSTRACT
This paper presents an end-to-end model designed to im- prove automatic speech recognition (ASR) for a particular speaker in a crowded, noisy environment. The model utilizes a single-channel speech enhancement module that isolates the speaker’s voice from background noise (ConVoiFilter) and an ASR module. The model can decrease ASR’s word error rate (WER) from 80% to 26.4% through this approach. Typically, these two components are adjusted independently due to vari- ations in data requirements.
This paper details a case study on cocktail party speech recog- nition. Instead of recognizing all speakers, our system focuses on enhancing the target speaker’s voice before conducting speech recognition. Through rigorous experiments, we show- cased the effectiveness of our improved end-to-end model. Noteworthy enhancements include a cross-extraction speaker encoder, an improved mask estimation model, and an opti- mized loss function. We also publicly share our pre-trained ConVoiFilter to
