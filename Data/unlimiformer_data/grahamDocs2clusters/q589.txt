Context: Paper title: 'WebArena: A Realistic Web Environment for Building Autonomous Agents' Published year: 2023 Publication venue or conference: arXiv.org Authors: Robert Lo, Frank F. Xu, Shuyan Zhou, Xuhui Zhou, Hao Zhu, Uri Alon, Daniel Fried, Abishek Sridhar, Graham Neubig, Yonatan Bisk, Xianyi Cheng Summary: This paper builds an environment for language-guided agents that is highly realistic and reproducible, and creates an environment with fully functional websites from four common domains:
(1) Information-seeking tasks expect a textual response. Importantly, these tasks in WebArena often require navigation across multiple pages or focus on user-centric content. This makes them distinct from open-domain question-answering (Yang et al., 2018; Kwiatkowski et al., 2019), which focuses on querying general knowledge with a simple retrieval step. For instance, to answer “When was the last time I bought the shampoo”, an agent traverses the user’s purchase history, checking order details
such as map, calculator, and scratchpad, to best support possible human-like task executions. Lastly, WebArena is complemented by an extensive collection of documentation and knowledge bases that vary from general resources like English Wikipedia to more domain-specific references, such as manuals for using the integrated development tool (Fan et al., 2022). The content populating these websites is extracted from their real-world counterparts, preserving the authenticity of the content served
