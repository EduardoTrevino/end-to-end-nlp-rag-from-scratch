Abstract
Recent advances in large language models have prompted researchers to examine their abilities across a variety of linguistic tasks, but little has been done to investigate how models han- dle the interactions in meaning across words and larger syntactic forms—i.e. phenomena at the intersection of syntax and semantics. We present the semantic notion of agentivity as a case study for probing such interactions. We created a novel evaluation dataset by utilitiz- ing the unique linguistic properties
Probing for LMs for their knowledge of agentiv- ity in syntactic constructions as in (1) and (2) is a particularly insightful case study as it allows us to explore three interconnected questions in a highly controlled syntactic setting:

I. Do models display sensitivity to aspects of word-level semantics independent of syntactic context, and is such sensitivity aligned with human judgements? (§3.1)
