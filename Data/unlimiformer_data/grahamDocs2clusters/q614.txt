A student may not take more than 60 units per semester, without permission from their academic advisor. Students must maintain full-time enrollment status (minimum of 36 units) in their final semester. 3.3.4 Prerequisite Core Course All MCDS students are expected to pass the 11-637 Foundations of Computational Data Science course by the end of their first semester. Each student must pass 11-637 with a grade of “B” or better. 3.3.5 Plan of study The degree consists of two timing options based on
New departments, new areas of study Along the way, the Center for Machine Translation became the Language Technologies Institute, and other new departments were formed, including the Human-Computer Interaction Institute (1993), the Institute for Software Research (1999), the Machine Learning Department (2006) and the Ray and Stephanie Lane Center for Computational Biology (2009). SCS’s seven degree-granting departments draw faculty and students from a wide variety of disciplines, including
17-637 Web Application Development
