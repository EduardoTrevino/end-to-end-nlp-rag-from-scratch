Question: When was the first Interfraternity Sweepstakes Race held?

Context: The first round of interviews took place in January 2022 with four academics from different departments at the University of York. The purpose was to gain insight into how they created their reading lists and found materials to include, specifically exploring the availability of OER and their inclusion on those lists. A thematic analysis was conducted and a copy of the report can be found in the Supplemental files. Suggestions from the first round about what should be included in the toolkit
participants recalled the rise of bench- marks in the late 1990s and early 2000s, coinciding with a major expansion in the NLP community in the wake of the “statistical revolution,” where participants described statistical models displacing more traditional rules-based work (see Figure 2). In the words of one participant, the field became of “such a big snowballing size that nobody owned the first evers anymore.” (26). Instead, after the release of the Penn Treebank in 1993 and the reporting of

1946 saw the return of Buggy, though not all of the Fraternities were back yet. It also saw a rain delay and a very controversial result.
Delta Upsilon entered a three-wheeled buggy in 1940.

It’s quirky, it’s different, and it’s so Carnegie Mellon University, where the college experience is a little buggy.

Sweepstakes, better known as the Spring Carnival Buggy Races, will celebrate its 100th anniversary April 17-18, 2020. The CMU tradition is unlike any other.
