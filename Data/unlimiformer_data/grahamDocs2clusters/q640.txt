Question: How many credits is Human Language for AI worth?

Context: The problem of aligning large language models (LLMs) to human values and intentions in terms of being comprehensive, respectful, and compliant1 [10, 32, 30, 4, 5, 27] has gained significant attention in research as recent AI systems (like ChatGPT or GPT-4) have rapidly advanced in their capabilities [12, 33, 7, 9]. Presently, state-of-the-art AI systems predominantly depend on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with human instructions and annotations, as well as reinforcement learning from human
the prefer- ences with the reward model, subsequently influencing the behavior of the RL- trained policies, and eliminating the reliance on the collection of online human preferences. Applying our method to the LLaMA-2-70b base language model, we developed an AI assistant named Dromedary-2. With only 6 exemplars for in-context learning and 31 human-defined principles, Dromedary-2 signifi- cantly surpasses the performance of several state-of-the-art AI systems, including LLaMA-2-Chat-70b, on
ities, making them exceptionally valuable for a wide range of AI applications [16]–[18]. One such model, Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) [16], is trained from scratch on an extensive dataset comprising 400 million (im- age, text) pairs. CLIP’s representations can seamlessly trans- fer to many downstream tasks without fine-tuning. While prior research has primarily focused on integrating audio modalities into CLIP’s embedding space [19], including a robot’s haptic data into this

In the event that a course is not available, a course covering equivalent material with a
Core Course: - Human Language for Artificial Intelligence (11-411)
course. No undergraduat e courses count toward the 195-unit requirement.

All Core courses are organized in sequence, and must be taken in the following order:

Artificial Intelligence and Future Markets (11-651) – No prerequisite.

AI Engineering (11-695) – Prerequisite is the co mpletion of 11-651 with a grade of “B” or

better.

LTI Practicum (11-935) – Three credit units for completing the required Internship.
