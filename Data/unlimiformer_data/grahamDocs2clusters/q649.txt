(cid:113) 64V log(9/α) 1−γ

Remark C.7 (Controlling false positive rate). The theorem implies that if we choose τ > 16Cmax log(9/α)

+ , then the false-positive rate is smaller than α. Note that V and Cmax can be computed directly from y, allowing us to choose an input-dependent τ as a function of V, Cmax that achieves a α-Type I error guarantee with a fixed α for all inputs. In particular, the Type I error α decreases exponentially as we increase the threshold τ .
