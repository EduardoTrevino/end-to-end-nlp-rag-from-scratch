Question: Which languages are included in the dataset released by "Multi-lingual and Multi-cultural Figurative Language Understanding"?

Context: Paper title: 'Multi-lingual and Multi-cultural Figurative Language Understanding' Published year: 2023 Publication venue or conference: Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics Authors: Alham Fikri Aji, Samuel Cahyawijaya, Perez Ogayo, Anuoluwapo Aremu, Graham Neubig, Anubha Kabra, Genta Indra Winata, Simran Khanuja, Emmy Liu Summary: This work assesses multilingual LMs' abilities to interpret figurative language in zero-shot and few-shot settings, and reveals that each
dataset, MABL, for seven diverse languages associated with a variety of cultures: Hindi, Indonesian, Javanese, Kannada, Sundanese, Swahili and Yoruba. Our dataset reveals that each language relies on cultural and regional concepts for fig- urative expressions, with the highest overlap between languages originating from the same region. We assess multilingual LMsâ€™ abili- ties to interpret figurative language in zero- shot and few-shot settings. All languages ex- hibit a significant deficiency
2 Linguistic and Cultural Biases of

Existing Figurative Language Datasets

To confirm the importance of building a multi- lingual, multi-cultural figurative language dataset, we first performed a pilot study to examine the fea- sibility of instead translating an existing figurative language dataset, Fig-QA (Liu et al., 2022), from
