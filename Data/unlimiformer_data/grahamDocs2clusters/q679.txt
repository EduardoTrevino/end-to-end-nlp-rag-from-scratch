Question: What was the model used for early buggies in the 1930s?

Context: In the supervised transfer learning setting—when pretraining on MS MARCO was used—the monoT5-220M model was still substantially more accurate than a 7x smaller MiniLM-30M ranker and this gap was not reduced by unsupervised fine-tuning using synthetically generated data.

– Outperforming BM25 with a small ranking model such as MiniLM-30M was possible by using: (a) a better model to generate synthetic training data (BLOOM instead of GPT-3 Curie), (b) consistency checking (Dai et al., 2022) (RQ3), and (c) all-domain pre-training, each of which helped improve outcomes.
However, when pretraining on MS MARCO was used, the monoT5-220M model was still substantially more accurate than a 7x smaller MiniLM-30M ranker. Moreover, this gap was not reduced by subsequent unsupervised fine-tuning of MiniLM-30M using synthetically generated data. The average gain over BM25 (see Table 1) was 1.46 for monoT5-200M pre-trained on MS MARCO vs. 1.24 for MiniLM-30M pre-trained on MS MARCO and fine-tuned using synthetic training data.

1948 – Design Competition (from the 1949 Thistle). Identified buggies: KapSig (3rd from the left, back row); PiKA (4th from the left, back row); Beta Sigma Rho (far left, back row). We also believe that the bottom buggy in the front row (3 wheels, no shell) belongs to Citcom Clan.

If you can ID any of the unknown buggies, let us know.

1949 – Design Competition (from the 1966 Buggy Book). Buggies are KapSig (far left), SAE’s design winner (#4, 2nd from the left), Men’s Dorms (#7, 3rd from the left), and DU (#11, far right).

1949 – SAE’s Design-winning buggy getting worked on (from the November 1949 issue of The Record, the SAE National Publication)

1949 – Citcom Clan Buggy (#9) (from the 1950 Thistle).
SAE’s buggy as a “sleek aluminum auto”, and DTD’s letter to the editor in 1951 complaining that if a team had used a “Buick grill” they would have placed in Design Comp, we’ve determined that Buggy #4 (2nd from the left in the Design Comp photo below) is actually SAE’s design winner. For a better look at the design, check out the 1950 photos, which is a similar style (though with different wheels, a different pushbar, and likely some other changes).] 1949 Photos. Here are photos from 1949.
