Question: Has Professor Carolyn Rose worked on Automatic Essay Scoring?

Context: In machine translation, Fernandes et al. (2022) and Freitag et al. (2022a) build upon recent ad- vances in automatic quality estimation and evalu- ation via feedback model training to improve gen- eration. Their framework comprises a candidate generation stage followed by a ranking stage, in which the candidates are scored using quality met- rics trained to regress on human assessments (re- ward models) (Rei et al., 2020a,b) via N -best list reranking or minimum Bayes risk (MBR) decod- ing
We studied how GEN evolved over time, by batching MONSERRATE corpus and evaluating the performance of the system as new patterns were learned and past ones were weighed. Results with automatic metrics showed that GEN was able to obtain higher overall scores across all metrics, in different parameterizations for the weighing strategies applied, when compared with the two baselines set: original patterns with no learning, and learning new patterns but not scoring them. The success of this
