000 problems each, with the same initial budget (2000 node expansions for Sokoban and The Witness, 7000 for STP) and stop as soon as the training set is entirely solved. Training LTS+CM for these domains took less than 2 hours each. Harder Sokoban. Additionally, we compare algorithms on the Boxoban ‘hard’ set of 3332 problems. Guez et al.
