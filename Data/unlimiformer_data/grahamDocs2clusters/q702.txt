Question: Where is advanced NLP taught this semester?

Context: et al., 2023; Lu et al., 2023; Liang et al., 2023). By combining plans, decisions, and executions into a pipeline, these frameworks aim to construct more advanced and versatile NLP systems for improving the performance of LLMs.
Natural language processing (NLP) is in a period of flux. The unprecedented advances of deep neu- ral networks and large language models (LLMs) in NLP coincides with a shift not only in the nature of our research questions and methodology, but also in the size and visibility of our field. Since the mid- 2010s, the number of first-time authors publishing in the ACL Anthology has been increasing expo- nentially (Figure 1). Recent publicity around NLP technology, most notably ChatGPT, has brought
using NLP to advance dogwhistle research. Even though LLMs’ performance is likely due to vast training data, and even then, their outputs require manual verification, our experiments with GPT-3 demonstrate that LLMs have some ability to sur- face dogwhistles and explain their covert meanings. This is particularly valuable as dogwhistles are in- tentionally hidden from out-group members, and out-group researchers may have no other way to access this information. There is thus a unique op-
