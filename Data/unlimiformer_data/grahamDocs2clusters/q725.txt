Question: Is the university open on January 15th 2024?

Context: The first round of interviews took place in January 2022 with four academics from different departments at the University of York. The purpose was to gain insight into how they created their reading lists and found materials to include, specifically exploring the availability of OER and their inclusion on those lists. A thematic analysis was conducted and a copy of the report can be found in the Supplemental files. Suggestions from the first round about what should be included in the toolkit
Before the survey was launched, an academic colleague from the University of Sheffield, who had previously indicated an interest in the project and was willing to be a critical friend, was approached for feedback about it. Their feedback was used to make minor amendments to the survey, and it was then circulated to teaching staff in all institutions using appropriate local channels during December 2021 and January 2022.
