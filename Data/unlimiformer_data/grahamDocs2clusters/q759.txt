Table 6: Results of six dataset combination configurations of 1.3B models and our LBS-7B model details are presented in Sec. 6. Bigbench is evaluated under 3-shot using the average of multiple choice grade. Arc easy and arc challenge are evaluated using 5-shot, 25-shot, and 25-shot, respectively. All other eval- uation benchmarks are tested on 0-shot. * represents the results are averaged across multiple sub-items inside each benchmark dataset.
