We test our system using datasets from different language pairs. Test datasets includes:

Test data from the IWSLT shared task (tst19, tst20) (Anastasopoulos et al., 2021, 2022), where the domain is TED talks.

ACL dev *
In the multilingual track, the testing condition is scientific conference talks. Therefore, we primarily rely on the ACL development (dev) set (Salesky et al., 2023) for validation. It consists of English transcripts of the talks and translations into the 10 target languages. The systems are then evaluated on a blind test set. The dev and test sets consist of 5 talks each. The paper abstracts for all talks are available in English. The talks are pre-segmented. In all experiments, we use the
