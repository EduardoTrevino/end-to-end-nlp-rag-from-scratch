We begin with the ACL Anthology and focus on papers between 1980 and 2022. Using the Semantic- Scholar (S2) API (Wade, 2022), we obtain author and citation information of papers indexed by S2 (some venues, such as some workshops, and some Findings8 papers, are not indexed, leaving 77, 235 papers), with a focus on citations of papers identified by our participants as having been influential to the NLP community. We select from this set of influential papers to generate the bar plots for Figure

nearly 1,700, including undergraduate, master’s and Ph.D. students, and conducted $124 million in research. Indeed, by itself, the Robotics Institute is the largest university robotics research group in the world, with more than 500 people and more than 100 ongoing research projects. A half-century ago, Perlis, Simon and Newell outlined a vision for computer science. The School of Computer Science at CMU remains committed to continuing and extending their vision in the context of big data and
