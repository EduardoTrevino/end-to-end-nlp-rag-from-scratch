Question: What does A-LoL use to filter negative advantage (low-quality) data points during training?

Context: incorporating sequence-level classifiers or human-designed scoring functions as rewards. Subsequently, by using LM’s internal sequence-level value estimate, A-LOL filters negative advantage (low-quality) data points during training, making it resilient to noise. Overall, A-LOL is an easy-to-implement LM training recipe that is sample-efficient and stable. We demonstrate the effectiveness of A-LOL and its variants with a set of four different language generation tasks. We compare against both
Overall, A-LOL and its variants consistently achieve high average reward with relatively low variance, even after discarding ≈33% of training data points. Further qualitative analysis reveals that the lowest negative advantage instances often indicate bad quality data (Appendix B.4). A-LOL methods perform comparably to DPO and outperform all other preference-based and reward-based baselines while generating the most diverse responses. Interestingly, A-LOL seq.

Surprisingly, the LMs trained on downvoted data with A-LOL almost close the gap with their counterparts trained on upvoted data. Upon closer inspection, we find that about 36% of upvoted replies and 48% of the downvoted replies in their respective training sets received a negative advantage and thus, were never sampled when finetuning with A-LOL. By filtering the unfavorable data points, A-LOL extracts the useful training signal even from suboptimal data. We called our method Leftover Lunch RL

11.4.4  Leave of Absence

The LTI discourages Leaves of Absence (LOA) since students usually do not return, despite

having good intentions. However,  a student in good standing may  be granted a LOA of at most

one year, upon written request to the MSAII Dire ctor and with the consent of the student's

advisor. It is the responsibility of  the student on LOA to contact th e LTI to initiate a return to
