Question: What is the task success rate of the GPT-4-based agent in WebArena?

Context: that humans routinely perform on the internet. We experiment with several baseline agents, integrating recent techniques such as reasoning before acting. The results demonstrate that solving complex tasks is challenging: our best GPT-4-based agent only achieves an end-to-end task success rate of 14.41%, significantly lower than the human performance of 78.24%. These results highlight the need for further development of robust agents, that current state-of-the-art large language models are far
We use this benchmark to evaluate several agents that can follow NL command and perform web- based tasks (§4). These agents are implemented in a few-shot in-context learning fashion with powerful large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 and PALM-2. Experiment results show that the best GPT-4 agent performance is somewhat limited, with an end-to-end task success rate of only 14.41%, while the human performance is 78.24%. We hypothesize that the limited performance of current LLMs stems from a
Table 1: Comparison of LLM-based agents on two SocialAI environments parsed into pure text (see figure 16). The best model (gpt-4) reached the success rates of 100% on AsocialBox, and 75% on ColorBoxes. The score of 75% suggests that the model is levering the peer to choose the correct box. When tested for generalization this model reached 55% success rate implying it is not able to generalize to a novel object. These expriments demontrate how LLM-based agents can be used in the SocialAI
