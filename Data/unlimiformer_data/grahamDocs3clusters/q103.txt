Question: What model does SYNTACC use for multi-accent speech synthesis?

Context: In the speech area, Wang et al. (2023a) treated text- to-speech synthesis as a language modeling task. They use audio codec codes as an intermediate rep- resentation and propose the first TTS framework with strong in-context learning capability. Subse- quently, VALLE-X (Zhang et al., 2023b) extend the idea to multi-lingual scenarios, demonstrating su- perior performance in zero-shot cross-lingual text- to-speech synthesis and zero-shot speech-to-speech translation tasks.
model mapping text to discrete tokens. MQTTS differs from these works in the use of multi-code, and the architecture de- signed for multi-code generation and monotonic alignment. MQTTS also learns codebooks specialized for speech syn- thesis instead of using SSL representations which may not contain sufﬁcient information for speech reconstruction.
Intelligibility of Synthetic Speech using WER from Pre- trained ASR: We computed the WER for synthetic speech generated by three different systems using the Whisper medium multilingual. This model is pre-trained on real speech and evaluated on synthetic speech. This setting of training / testing demonstrates the traditional way that speech synthesis evaluation is performed. This evaluation was per- formed on both the test-clean and test-other datasets from LibriTTS.
