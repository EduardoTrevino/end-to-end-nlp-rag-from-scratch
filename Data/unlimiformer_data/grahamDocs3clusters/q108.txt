Question: What is the term for the discrepancies between increases in computational throughput and reductions in floating point operations, and improvements in wall-clock inference latency?

Context: Increased focus on the computational efficiency of NLP systems has motivated the design of ef- ficient model architectures and improvements to underlying hardware accelerators. How- ever, the resulting increases in computational throughput and reductions in floating point op- erations have not directly translated to improve- ments in wall-clock inference latency. We demonstrate that these discrepancies can be largely attributed to bottlenecks introduced by deep learning frameworks. We denote
Models (e.g. over API) introduces a new computational trade-off. Specifically, the interplay between Computational Time (CT) and Travel Time (TT). An increase in computation that results in reduced travel time might lead to overall efficiency gains depending on the amount of computational time required. Colloquially, when is it faster to think before acting, versus acting on a hunch?
We introduce the concept of the framework tax to describe when improvements in hardware speed and reductions in required computation fail to trans- late to speedups in model latency and throughput due to bottlenecks incurred by deep learning frame- works. We hope that these observations raise aware- ness of the impact and limitations created by choice of deep learning frameworks on model develop- ment and deployment.
