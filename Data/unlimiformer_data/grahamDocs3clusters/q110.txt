Abstract
Fourrier (2022) compares statistical machine translation, RNN, and Transformer architectures for protoform reconstruction, but they evaluate their results using BLEU scores (Papineni et al., 2002) instead of edit distance. They find that their Transformer model did not outperform the RNN models on protoform reconstruction. In addition, their multilingual NMT (neural machine transla- tion) model predicts many languages instead of one target language and is trained on bilingual pairs for

projects.) Even self -supporting MLT students are expected to perform research with a faculty

advisor, since research experience is an important part of our graduate programs. Until a student finds a specific advisor, the chair of the LTI graduate prog rams serves as the advisor.

How to change advisors:  The initial advisor selection should be made carefully. However, it is

possible to change advisors. To do so, the student should find another faculty member willing
offered by the Language Technologies Institute (LTI), a graduate department in the School of

Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University. The MIIS degree provides advanced study

and practical experience in areas of Computer Science focused on the processing and analysis

of unstructured and semi -structured information, for example, text, image, video, speech, and

audio information. It is a practice -oriented professional degree designed for students who
