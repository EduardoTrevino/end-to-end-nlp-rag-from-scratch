Question: What is the BartScore achieved by the CRL-COM (R) system from the paper Improving Factuality of Abstractive Summarization via Contrastive Reward Learning, on the XSUM dataset?

(2020) proposed an unsupervised abstractive summarization model that generates summaries directly from source documents by optimizing coverage, ﬂuency, and brevity using reinforcement learning (RL)-based rewards. Yadav et al. (2021) introduced two novel question-aware semantic rewards for abstractive question summarization: (1) question-type identiﬁcation and (2) question-focus recognition. They integrated these rewards into an encoder- decoder-based ProphetNet transformer model (Qi et al.
BARTScore (Yuan et al., 2021) formulates the text generation evaluation as a text generation task from pretrained language models in an unsuper- vised fashion. When the generated text is better, the training model will get a higher score by convert- ing the generated text to reference or source text. BART score can be applied to different evaluations (e.g., informativeness, coherence, and factuality). Perplexity (Chen et al., 1998) calculates lan- guage model perplexity. Perplexity quantifies

Carnegie Mellon University. The staff work with  researchers to ensure research is conducted

with integrity and in accordance with federa l and Pennsylvania regulation. ORIC assists

researchers with human subject re search, conflicts of interest, re sponsible conduct of research,

export controls, and institutional animal care & us e.  ORIC also provides consultation, advice,
