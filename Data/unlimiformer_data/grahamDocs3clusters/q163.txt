Question: In spring 2024, How many units is course 17214?

Context: Eq. (2) encapsulates the recurrence relation of the S4 models (Gu et al., 2022; Gupta et al., 2022), S5 model (Smith et al., 2023), and Linear Recurrent Unit (Orvieto et al., 2023). For example, A is in the family of HiPPO matrix (Gu et al., 2023) in S4 or a complex diagonal matrix in Linear Recurrent Unit. We show in Proposition 1 that such input- independent A matrix cannot represent subtraction.

Proposition 1. An input-independent LRNN is in- consistent in representing subtraction.
Our translation system is built on these 5 train- ing units: an optional [M2M100] (Fan et al., 2021), [N]2, [N+1]2, [N+1] and [1]2. These 5 stages in- crease in speciﬁcity while they decrease in data size. Building on them, we show 24 different train- ing schedules, among which 8 are pretrained with in-domain data and 16 are pretrained with out-of- domain large multilingual models (Figure 3). We only consider models with pretraining and there- fore do not exhaust all 32 training schedules.
1024 hidden states, 16 attention heads, 1024 word vector size, 4,096 hidden units, 0.2 la- bel smoothing, 0.0002 training learning rate and ﬁnetuning 0.00005 learning rate, 0.1 dropout and attention dropout, “adam” optimizer and “noam” decay method (Fan et al., 2021; Schwenk et al., 2021; El-Kishky et al., 2020).

10-601, Machine Learning (12 units), First fall semester. (Normally

11-691, Math for Machine Learni ng, which is not being offered in Fall 2022.)
10-605, Machine Learning with Large Data sets (12 units). First spring semester.

11-611, Natural Language Processing (12 units). Second fall semester.

One more 12-unit AI, ML or NLP course of the student’s choice (with approval of the

Program Director)

In the event that a course is not available, a course covering equivalent material with a
There are two course components required for students who elect to complete the M.S. Thesis: 11 -928 – Masters ’ Thesis I (with the chosen thesis advisor, typically for 12 units,

typically in the Fall of their second year) and 11 -929 – Masters ’ Thesis II in the following

Spring.

Each of these two courses counts towards 6 units of MLT -level LTI course credit; if the

student goes on to an LTI PhD, the second course (11 -929) counts towards one PhD lab

requirement.
