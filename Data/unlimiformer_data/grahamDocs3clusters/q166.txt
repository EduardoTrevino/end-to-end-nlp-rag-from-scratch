Question: What is the name of the novel framework introduced for learning unified multi-sensory object property representations?

Context: capability to tackle complex manipulation tasks. Our research introduces a versatile framework for learning unified multi-sensory representations from raw sensory data acquired during robot-object interactions, offering adaptabil- ity across diverse downstream tasks. The generality of our network architecture has been is demonstrated across various applications with strong performance, and the inclusion of self-attention mechanisms further bolsters its performance. Unified Multi-Sensory
We introduce MOSAIC (Multi-modal Object property learning with Self-Attention and Integrated Comprehension), an approach to acquire versatile representations adaptable to various interactive perception tasks within robotics. MO- SAIC is designed to extract unified multi-sensory object property representations, enabling understanding of object properties by leveraging diverse sensory modalities. This approach rests on the premise that natural language provides a versatile embedding space whose
Abstract— A holistic understanding of object properties across diverse sensory modalities (e.g., visual, audio, and haptic) for tasks ranging from object catego- rization to complex manipulation. Drawing inspiration from cognitive science studies that emphasize the significance of multi-sensory integration in human perception, we introduce MOSAIC (Multi-modal Object property learning with Self- Attention and Integrated Comprehension), a novel framework designed to facilitate the learning of
