In machine translation, Fernandes et al. (2022) and Freitag et al. (2022a) build upon recent ad- vances in automatic quality estimation and evalu- ation via feedback model training to improve gen- eration. Their framework comprises a candidate generation stage followed by a ranking stage, in which the candidates are scored using quality met- rics trained to regress on human assessments (re- ward models) (Rei et al., 2020a,b) via N -best list reranking or minimum Bayes risk (MBR) decod- ing

The MLT thesis may focus on either a significant research result or a significant implementation of a new technology. The student should work with their adv isor to

define an interesting but bounded thesis research project. The MLT thesis culminates in MLT Graduate Student Handbook  Page 16

a publication -quality paper that clearly describes the work in terms of its research

significance.

The MLT thesis committee will be composed of a thesis advisor  and two additional
20. Kidney donor matching, 2008 Organ transplants save lives every day, but more people could likely be saved if it was easier to match recipients with donors who are unrelated. An algorithm developed by CMU scientists is close to enabling a nationwide network that would match living kidney donors with potential recipients whom they've never met in real life.
A review of the University’s Academic Disciplinary Actions procedures is also recommended. These procedures outline the process for investigating, reporting, and adjudicating violations of the University Policy on Academic Integrity. The procedures also outline the appeals process.
