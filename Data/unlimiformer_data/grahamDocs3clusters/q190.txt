We evaluate both (1) intrinsic aspects of phonetic word embeddings, such as word retrieval and correlation with sound similarity, and (2) extrinsic performance on tasks such as rhyme and cognate detection and sound analogies. We hope our task suite will promote reproducibility and inspire future phonetic embedding research.
We introduce four phonetic word embedding methods—count-based, autoencoder, and metric and contrastive learning. Though some of these techniques are inspired by previous work, we are the first to apply them with supervision from articu- latory feature vectors, a seldom-exploited form of
