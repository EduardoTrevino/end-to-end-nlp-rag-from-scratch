Watson and Li (2014) researchers at Durham University in the United Kingdom, calculated a high failure rate in the achievement level of students in the subject of introduction to computer programming. The study describes the results of 161 introductory computer programming courses that were conducted in 15 diﬀerent countries, in which the average pass rate was found to be 67.7%, therefore, the average failure rate is 32.3%. However, despite several studies conducted on the topic of achievement
Portnoﬀ (2018) says that the 10 years he has been a teacher in an introductory computer programming course, he has used

the phenomena arising from them.” In 1958, Perlis began teaching the first freshman-level computer programming course in the United States at Carnegie Tech.
First freshman-level computer science course In 1956 and 1957, Simon, Allen Newell (IA’57) and Cliff Shaw of RAND designed the Logic Theorist, a computer program that could develop proofs for theorems in much the same way a human would work. They also developed linked-list data structures, the foundation of computer programming. Perlis, Simon and Newell are credited with defining the term “computer science” as “the theory and design of computers,” as well as (in Newell’s words) “the study of
Computer Science, effective Dec. 1, and that the School of Computer Science would soon begin operations. SCS made its formal debut on Dec. 22, 1988, with a reception in the Wherrett Room of Skibo Hall, CMU’s student union. The official announcement of CMU’s new “graduate School of Computer Science” was made Jan. 3, 1989.
