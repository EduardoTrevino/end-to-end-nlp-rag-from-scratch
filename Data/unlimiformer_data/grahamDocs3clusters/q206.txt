Series in 2022. Again, this of course says noth- ing about the fundamental limits of language models, and even GPT-2, for example, seems to be able to infer from distributional evidence, that the answer to Is 1900 in the past or in the future? is It is in the past, while the answer to Is 2022 in the past or in the future?, is It is in the future. Obviously, since lan- guage models are not generally trained on time-stamped text, there is a limit to what can be inferred from distributional
