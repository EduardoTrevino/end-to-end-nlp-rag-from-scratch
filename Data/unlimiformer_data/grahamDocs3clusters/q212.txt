For 10 = 2 · 5, there is no possibility to have fewer than 2 secondary groups. • For 15 = 3·5, the only option is having 2 groups of 15 together, making it 2·15 = 30. There does not seem to be any evidence of any culture using base-30 number systems.

For 20 = 4 · 5, we have two options:

– having 3 groups of 20, making it 3 · 20 = 60; and – having 2 groups of 20, making it 2 · 20 = 40.

The last two options provide an explanation of why 60 and 40 were used as bases.
