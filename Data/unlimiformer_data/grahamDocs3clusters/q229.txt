in more distinct risk groups than single-phenotype PGS. The disorder with the largest increase in prediction accuracy from multi-PGS was ADHD, with a ninefold increased prediction R2over the single PGS (corresponding to ~40% of the SNP h2f35). This is mostly due to the inclusion of various behavioral PGS in our library (educational attain- ment, smoking status, etc.) with very large sample sizes and large genetic correlation with ADHD.
daily mood and a mother-adolescent datasets to predict affective state sequences where half the mothers experience symptoms of depression.
The results varied greatly for each phenotype, but there were large increases in prediction accuracy of the multi-PGS for most phe- notypes (Fig. 5). The multi-PGS for the disorder pair ASD/ADHD showed the largest prediction R2 of all examined multi-PGS, explaining 12% of the variation. On the other side of the spectrum, the multi-PGS for outcomes such as APGAR score, gestational age or BD/MDD showed null R2. Note that the PGS labeled MDD Howard30 is selected as the top lasso weighted PGS for

professional education. Drawing on Shaw’s plan and also on the work of other faculty members, an undergraduate program in computer science was created during the 1989-90 academic year. Seven CS majors were admitted to the program as sophomores. Another 73 undergraduates were admitted in 1990–91. By 1995, there were 401 undergraduates in the School of Computer Science; in fall 2013, more than 600 undergraduates made up about 37 percent of student enrollment at SCS, along with more than 600
