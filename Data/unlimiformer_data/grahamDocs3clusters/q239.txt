Question: What does POMDP stand for?

Context: The WebArena environment is denoted as E= ⟨S, A, O, T ⟩ with state space S, action space A (§2.4) and observation space O (§2.3). The transition function T : S × A−→ S is deterministic, and it is defined by the underlying implementation of each website in the environment. Performing a task described by a natural language intent i can be formulated as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP): at each time step t, an agent issues an action at∈ A given the partial observation ot∈ O.

The Neyman-Scott process (NSP) was ﬁrst proposed by Neyman and Scott (1958). NSPs are a class of hierarchical point process models built by stacking Poisson processes into a network. NSPs were originally univariate, i.e., can only be applied to events with one type or mark. Hong and Shelton (2022) introduce multivariate NSPs with hi- erarchical structures, called deep Neyman-Scott processes (DNSPs). We use “deep” to differentiate our work from other work that only has one hidden layer (e.g.,

Multi-processor machines emerge CSD emerged from the brief crisis as a highly agile, interdisciplinary entity, with many new faculty members taking joint appointments with other CMU departments. Several large projects emerged in the Computer Science Department, including C.mmp, the first shared-memory multiprocessor computer, with 16 processing units, and Cm*, a 50-processor computer. These computers were the forerunners of today’s ubiquitous multi-core desktops and laptops.
