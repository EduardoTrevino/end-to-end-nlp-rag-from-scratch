information in different languages. In this work, we analyze the effect of this non- uniformity on the fairness of an API’s pricing policy across languages. We conduct a system- atic analysis of the cost and utility of OpenAI’s language model API on multilingual bench- marks in 22 typologically diverse languages. We show evidence that speakers of a large num- ber of the supported languages are overcharged while obtaining poorer results. These speak- ers tend to also come from regions where the
