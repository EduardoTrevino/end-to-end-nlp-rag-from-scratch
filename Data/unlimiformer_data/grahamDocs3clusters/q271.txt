Question: What are the course number(s) for the NLP course?

Context: ▶ Proposition 23. The classes coLP and NLP are incomparable, even when restricted to graphs of bounded structural degree. More precisely, coLP|graph(∆) (cid:1)(cid:1)⋚ NLP|graph(∆) for all ∆ ≥ 3, and a fortiori coLP (cid:1)(cid:1)⋚ NLP.
ℓ }ℓ∈N as the local-polynomial hierarchy. Two classes at the lowest levels are of particular interest: LP = Σlp 0 (for local-polynomial time) and NLP = Σlp 1 (for nondeterministic local-polynomial time). Due to the asymmetric nature of acceptance by unanimity, classes on the same level of the local-polynomial hierarchy are neither complement classes of each other, nor are they closed under complementation (see Corollary 38 on page 63). Therefore, it makes sense to also consider the hierarchy of
Two classes at the lowest levels of the hierarchy are of particular interest: LP = Σlp 0 (for local-polynomial time) is the class of graph properties that can be decided by a local- polynomial machine, and NLP = Σlp 1 (for nondeterministic local-polynomial time) is the class of graph properties that can be verified by a local-polynomial machine. Accordingly, Σlp 1 -arbiters are also called LP-deciders and NLP-verifiers, respectively.
