Question: What does FLARE stand for?

Context: FLARE is applicable to any existing LMs at inference time without additional training. Con-
long texts, where continually gathering in- formation throughout generation is essential. In this work, we provide a generalized view of ac- tive retrieval augmented generation, methods that actively decide when and what to retrieve across the course of the generation. We propose Forward-Looking Active REtrieval augmented generation (FLARE), a generic method which iteratively uses a prediction of the upcoming sentence to anticipate future content, which is then utilized as a query to retrieve
The initial query of FLARE. FLARE starts with the user input x as the initial query to re- trieve documents to generate the first sentence Ë†s1 = LM([Dx, x]) to bootstrap the iterative gener- ation process. For the following steps, the tempo- rary forward-looking sentence is generated without retrieved documents.
