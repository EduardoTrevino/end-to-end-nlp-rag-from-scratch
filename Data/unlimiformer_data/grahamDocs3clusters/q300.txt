Question: How many papers does Alexander Hauptmann have on Semantic Scholar?

Context: We begin with the ACL Anthology and focus on papers between 1980 and 2022. Using the Semantic- Scholar (S2) API (Wade, 2022), we obtain author and citation information of papers indexed by S2 (some venues, such as some workshops, and some Findings8 papers, are not indexed, leaving 77, 235 papers), with a focus on citations of papers identified by our participants as having been influential to the NLP community. We select from this set of influential papers to generate the bar plots for Figure
