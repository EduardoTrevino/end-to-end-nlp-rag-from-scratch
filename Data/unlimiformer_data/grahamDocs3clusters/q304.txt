Question: What does TASTE use to better characterize user behaviors?

Context: ness than TASTE (Rand Negs). This phenomenon illustrates that these hard negatives are also high-potentially interacted with users and are usually not the real negatives. Besides, benefiting from our attention sparsity method, TASTE achieves further improvements, demonstrating its effectiveness in characterizing user behaviors by modeling longer-term user-item interactions.
lengths of 256 and 512 for user-item interaction history, splitting them into 4 or 2 subsequences. Then we evaluate the memory usage and recommendation performance of TASTE. Overall, by adding more subsequences or extending their lengths to model additional user-interacted items, TASTE achieves more accurate recommenda- tion results. It demonstrates that modeling longer user-item interac- tion sequences can help to better characterize user behaviors [45]. When the sequences are separated into
ABSTRACT This paper proposes Text mAtching based SequenTial rEcommenda- tion model (TASTE), which maps items and users in an embedding space and recommends items by matching their text representa- tions. TASTE verbalizes items and user-item interactions using identifiers and attributes of items. To better characterize user be- haviors, TASTE additionally proposes an attention sparsity method, which enables TASTE to model longer user-item interactions by reducing the self-attention computations

Design, implement and evaluate a user experience prototype to allow for clear understanding of data science solutions.

Apply social and behavioral research methods to data science problems to understand the human aspects of data collection and analysis.
8. User interfaces, 1983 Why should humans adapt to fit computers? Shouldn’t computers adapt to fit humans? That was the attitude of CMU researchers, who applied design principles to computer science to develop better, easier-to-use interfaces. They called the new field “human-computer interaction.”
