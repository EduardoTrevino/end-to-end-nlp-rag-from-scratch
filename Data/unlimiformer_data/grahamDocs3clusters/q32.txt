Question: What's the paper title for the paper that released a method called IPA?

Context: been asked for experiments that were too expensive for them, a clear majority of the partic- ipants (83.7%) would like to require reviewers to justify their petitions for more experiments (ùëÑ16). Lastly, we also see a large majority (75.6%) that be- lieved that their work could benefit from the release of small versions of pretrained models alongside large ones (ùëÑ17). To promote this, a majority of our respondents thought that venues should have a visible branding of papers to release a model
