computer science in the public school system. It also promotes the implementation of computer science in the classroom, for which it develops curricular courses from the ﬁrst year of primary education to the fourth year of secondary education, which are available as a public good for the entire school system, articulating an ecosystem to train and accompany teachers and develop a network of leading schools in the teaching of computer science, which by July 2022 there were more than 80 schools

MCDS students must also pass the undergraduate course 15-513 Introduction to Computer Systems (6 units), typically in the summer before their program commences. The student must pass with a grade of B- or better. Failure to pass the course means that the student takes 15-213 during either the fall or spring semester. Note that in both cases the units do not count toward the 144 eligible units of study. Click here to see the MCDS Course Map. Some example courses of study are included below.
