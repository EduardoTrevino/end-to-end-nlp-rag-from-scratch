Question: What time in the day does SafeWalk end?

Context: If-needed rules are not checked until a value is explicitly requested, so adding knowledge ‚Äú10:30 AM is the start time of meeting 27‚Äù and ‚Äú11:30 AM is the end time of meeting 27‚Äù should not activate any triggers. The absence of any inherited triggers on {start time} and {end time} ensures this behavior. Once the value for the slot Ô¨Åller {the duration of meeting 27} is requested, an upscan is performed on role node {duration}, which Ô¨Ånds trigger (R C). This trigger is activated by substituting
Suppose we Ô¨Ånd out that ‚Äú11:30 AM is the end time of meeting 27‚Äù and add this to the knowledge base. This causes an upscan on {end time} to Ô¨Ånd inherited rule triggers, which Ô¨Ånds trigger (R B C) on {end time}. Activating the rule trigger by substituting {11:30 AM} for B and {meeting 27} for C (as shown in Figure 4.5) is successful because there are no violated predicates, so the search algorithm looks for an element for the unsubstituted variable A.

of reaction time it starts to decelerate and brakes at a distance of ùë• meters. In order to avoid a collision with the obstacle, the left AGV needs to generate sufficient deceleration. However, if the deceleration is too large, it may cause the goods on the AGV to slide or even fall thus causing a safety hazard.
