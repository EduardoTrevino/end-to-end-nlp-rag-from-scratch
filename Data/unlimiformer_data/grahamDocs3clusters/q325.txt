Question: When was the two-wheeled buggy eliminated?

Context: Baselines We compare GINSEW with He et al. (2021) and CATER (He et al., 2022). Specifically, He et al. (2021) pro- pose two watermarking approaches: the first one replaces all the watermarked words with their synonyms; the second one watermarks the victim API outputs by mixing American and British spelling systems.

The MLSUM Turkish subset was built by crawling the articles on Turkish website (Internet Haber) between 2010 and 2019. All articles under 50 words and summaries under 10 words were eliminated. The data was split into train, validation, and test sets, with respect to the publishing dates.

Figure 4: Comparison of two code implementations for printing 2k − 1 consecutive numbers centered around the input x. The faster code (right) optimizes the process by directly computing the range without the need for nested loops, resulting in a more efficient and concise solution. The red highlighted portion in the slower code (left) indicates the wasteful nested loop that was eliminated in the optimized version. This loop unnecessarily iterates over a large range of numbers, only to perform a
