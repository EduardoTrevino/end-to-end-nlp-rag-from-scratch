We ran evaluations on VQAv2 [24] and image captioning on MS-COCO [34]. The results are presented in Tab. 7. We found that GILL is comparable to models trained with similar compute and data. On VQAv2, we achieve a zero-shot val accuracy of 0.3178, which is slightly better than prior approaches of similar model sizes and compute: FROMAGe [31] achieves a zero-shot accuracy of 0.2851, Frozen [56] achieves 0.2553, and MAGMA [19] achieves 0.2835. For image captioning on the MS-COCO (2017) validation
In addition to the above evaluations, we also ran the zero- shot VQAv2 (Goyal et al., 2017). We apply the same nor- malization techniques from their GitHub repo6, and prompt the model with the prefix Q: {question} A: format. On zero-shot VQA, our model achieves a score of 28.51, which is better or comparable to prior methods: a reim- plementation of Frozen achieves 25.53, while running the MAGMA pretrained model (which uses 25M image-text as training data, including the VQA training set),

Tartan, Heat 1 saw a very tight race between KapSig, DTD, and PiKA, with KapSig winning in 3:24.5, DTD finishing in 3:25.1, and PiKA finishing in 3:26.3. Those were the top 3 times and they advanced to the finals. Prelim Heat 2 paired Beta, SAE, and DU, and SAE won the heat by default, as Beta was DQ’d for a pushbar violation and DU was DQ’d for a Hill 4-5 transition violation (the Tartan reports that they “shoved the buggy into the last zone instead of pushing it”). Prelims Heat 3 was a battle
the 3 teams qualifying for Finals, broke the post-war record. In the finals, it was another close battle, with DTD squeaking it out over PiKA. DTD’s winning time of 2:42.5 was fast enough to set the course record, and PiKA’s 2:43.5 was only ½ second behind the prior record. SAE’s Best Design. SAE took home the trophy for Design Comp with their sleek aluminum buggy. Unfortunately, we haven’t found a photo. [Ed. Update: Based on the buggies from 1950, the 1950 Thistle’s actual description of
