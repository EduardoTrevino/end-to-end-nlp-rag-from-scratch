Question: What is the title of the paper that proposes a novel re-ranker model abbreviated FiT5?

Context: Common IR pipelines are typically cascade sys- tems that may involve multiple rankers and/or fusion models to integrate different informa- tion step-by-step. In this paper, we propose a novel re-ranker named Fusion-in-T5 (FiT5), which integrates document text information, retrieval features, and global document in- formation into a single unified model using templated-based input and global attention. Ex- periments on passage ranking benchmarks MS MARCO and TREC DL show that FiT5 sig-

In this paper, we introduce Fusion-in-T5 (FiT5), a T5-based (Raffel et al., 2020) re-ranking model that collects ranking signals and ranks documents within a unified framework. FiT5 is designed to consolidate multiple IR features, including doc- ument texts, ranking features, and global docu- ment information, into a single learnable model. Specifically, the input to FiT5 is formulated us- ing a template that incorporates the document text with the ranking feature, which is represented as
