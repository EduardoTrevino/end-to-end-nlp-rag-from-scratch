Question: Which LTI professors wrote "Rethinking Voice-Face Correlation: A Geometry View"?

Context: To investigate and understand the voice-face correlation at a more fine-grained phoneme level, we propose an anal- ysis pipeline that leverages a common feature extractor with a regression head to predict human anthropometric measure- ments (AM) from phoneme. Specifically, Human anthropomet- ric measurements are a set of facial measurements summarized from cognitive science studies that can effectively represent the identity of a human. We decompose the audio recordings into phonemes and learn
particularly with plosives. Additionally, we observe that if a specific AM exhibits more movement during phoneme pro- nunciation, it is more predictable. Our findings support those in physiology regarding correlation and lay the groundwork for future research on speech-face multimodal learning. Index Terms: voice-face correlation, phoneme
The implicit relation between speech and anthropometry fea- tures has been extensively researched in recent years. Nu- merous voice profiling studies [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] have shown that human voice carries a plethora of information about the speaker, making it possible to deduce biophysical characteris- tics of speakers, e.g., gender, age and health conditions, from their voice. However, in criminal profiling scenarios, the study of correlations between voice and face becomes essential. In

1.2 Department Personnel

The people responsible for administering the LTI Ph.D.  degree are:

Jamie Callan

Ph.D. Program Director

Professor

GHC 5419

callan@cs.cmu.edu
At least two LTI faculty members will attend the presentation, including the research advisor.

After the presentation, these faculty members will convene and provide written feedback to both the student and the Program Director  of graduate programs (the form for this is available on the

LTI website). This feedback will help the student refine speaking skills with respect to talk

structure, content,  and delivery.

3.2 Advising
At least two CMU faculty members will attend the presentation, including the research advisor.

After the presentation, these faculty members will convene and provide written feedback to both the student and the chair of graduate programs (the form for this is available on the LTI website). This feedback will help the student refine speaking skills with respect to talk structure, content, and delivery.
