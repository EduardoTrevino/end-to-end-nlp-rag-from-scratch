Question: The TASTE algorithm was introduced in what paper?

Context: ABSTRACT This paper proposes Text mAtching based SequenTial rEcommenda- tion model (TASTE), which maps items and users in an embedding space and recommends items by matching their text representa- tions. TASTE verbalizes items and user-item interactions using identifiers and attributes of items. To better characterize user be- haviors, TASTE additionally proposes an attention sparsity method, which enables TASTE to model longer user-item interactions by reducing the self-attention computations
6 CONCLUSION In this paper, we propose a Text mAtching based SequenTial rEcommendation (TASTE) model, which represents users and items with text utterances and leans text matching signals to model the relevance between them. TASTE achieves the state-of-the-art on widely used sequential recommendation datasets. It outperforms
In this paper, we propose Text mAtching based SequenTial rEcommendation (TASTE), which represents items and users with texts, establishes relevance between them by matching their text representations and alleviates the popularity bias of previous item id based recommendation models. TASTE verbalizes users and items by designing some prompts [39] and filling up the templates with item ids and item attributes. The item information provides text- matching clues to model the dependency and
