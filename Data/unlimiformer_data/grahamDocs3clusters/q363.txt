The MOORA method is a multiobjective optimizing system that can have two or more attributes that are not related. The MOORA method was first introduced by a scientist named Braurers in 2004 to solve various problems in making difficult decisions [12]. Since its introduction by Braurers, MOORA has been widely used to solve decision-making problems to provide accurate and reliable results [13]. In Muhammad Fachrizal Anshary et al.'s research, it was concluded that the MOORA method has a good
The first toplogical index introduced by Wiener, during the research of paraffin melting point. Initially termed “path number”, it was later renamed and has since become known as the Wiener index. Researchers have put a lot of effort into studying chemical graph theory. A key component of graph theory’s work involves honeycomb networks. The honeycomb shape, with its hexagonal pattern of cells, finds a wide range of applications across various fields due to its unique structural and geometric

1947 – DU’s Flying Pork Barrel (with cowboy hat-adorning driver) being pushed on the Back Hills (from the 1948 Thistle). DU would go on to earn their first and only Buggy championship. The three wheeled buggy trailing appears to be DTD. This might be the Finals.

1947 – KapSig’s Buggy (from the 1948 Thistle)

1947 – PiKA’s buggy (from the 1948 Thistle).

Delta Upsilon entered a three-wheeled buggy in 1940.

It’s quirky, it’s different, and it’s so Carnegie Mellon University, where the college experience is a little buggy.

Sweepstakes, better known as the Spring Carnival Buggy Races, will celebrate its 100th anniversary April 17-18, 2020. The CMU tradition is unlike any other.
1946 was the first clue, since the 3 buggies advancing to the Finals were from the same Prelim Heat. But in 1947, it became more obvious, as there were 4 Prelim Heats but only the 3 teams with the fastest Prelim times advanced to the Finals. Prelims. Sadly, the 1947 Tartan was not very interested in Buggy, so we don’t know much about the race. In fact, all we really know from the Tartan is that PhiKap’s buggy was built by DeBolt, Malenock, Butters, and Gregg, and was driven by Danny Gallo. But
