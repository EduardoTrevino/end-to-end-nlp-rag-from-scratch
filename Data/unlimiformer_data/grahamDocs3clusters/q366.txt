Question: What data source do authors in "Towards Open-Domain Twitter User Profile Inference" collect their public user profiles from?

Context: Paper title: 'Towards Open-Domain Twitter User Profile Inference' Published year: 2023 Publication venue or conference: Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics Authors: Haoyang Wen, Zhenxin Xiao, Alexander Hauptmann, E. Hovy Summary: None
As large datasets from social media platforms (e.g., Twitter, Face- book, Reddit, etc) are used to investigate research questions not only about platform use, but about social dynamics more generally, these platforms may suﬀer from a ‘model organism’ problem [150], where claims are made about the world in general, based on data from one speciﬁc organism, such as mice or fruit ﬂies (or here: one speciﬁc social media platform). In reality, there is a non-random selection of users into social
The OpenWebText data set [8] is a publicly available resource that comprises web content sourced from URLs shared on Reddit with a minimum of three votes. This data set is a reconstitution of the original WebText corpus, which was initially described by Radford et al. [9]. Since the data set was compiled in 2019, it is improbable that the textual content it contains was algorithmically generated.
