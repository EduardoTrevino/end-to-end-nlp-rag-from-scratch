Question: What is the name of the new class of offline policy gradient algorithms introduced in the paper "Improving Language Models with Advantage-based Offline Policy Gradients"?

Context: Paper title: 'Improving Language Models with Advantage-based Offline Policy Gradients' Published year: 2023 Publication venue or conference: arXiv.org Authors: Faeze Brahman, Ronan Le Bras, Ashutosh Baheti, Ximing Lu, Maarten Sap, Mark O. Riedl Summary: Advantage-Leftover Lunch RL (A-LoL), a new class of offline policy gradient algorithms that enable RL training on any pre-existing data that assumes the entire LM output sequence as a single action, and allows incorporating sequence-level
Language Models (LMs) achieve substantial language capabilities when finetuned using Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF). However, RLHF is an unstable and data-hungry process that continually requires new high-quality LM-generated data for finetuning. We introduce Advantage-Leftover Lunch RL (A-LOL), a new class of offline policy gradient algorithms that enable RL training on any pre-existing data. By assuming the entire LM output sequence as a single action, A-LOL allows
