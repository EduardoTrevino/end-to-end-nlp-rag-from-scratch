projects.) Even self -supporting MLT students are expected to perform research with a faculty

advisor, since research experience is an important part of our graduate programs. Until a student finds a specific advisor, the chair of the LTI graduate prog rams serves as the advisor.

How to change advisors:  The initial advisor selection should be made carefully. However, it is

possible to change advisors. To do so, the student should find another faculty member willing
