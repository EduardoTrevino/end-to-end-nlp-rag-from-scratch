Electives (Choose Three): - Natural Language Processing (11-411) - Machine Learning for Text and Graph-based Mining (11-441) - Search Engines (11-442) - Speech Processing (11-492) - Machine Learning in Practice (11-344) - Advanced Natural Language Processing (11-711) - Machine Translation and Sequence-to-Sequence Models (11-731) - Multilingual Natural Language Processing (11-737) - Neural Networks for NLP (11-747) - Speech Recognition and Understanding (11-751) - Language and Statistics
Information retrieval, machine translation and speech technology are used daily by the general public, while text mining, natural language processing and language-based tutoring are common within more specialized professional or educational environments. The LTI prepares students for this world by offering a minor that gives you the opportunity to not only learn about language technologies, but to also apply that knowledge through a directed project.
