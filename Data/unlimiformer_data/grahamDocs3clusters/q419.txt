Question: How many de-biased training examples were used for fine-tuning the pre-trained model to significantly reduce the tendency to favor any gender?

Context: changes to the training regime, in this paper, we propose data intervention strategies as a powerful yet simple technique to reduce gender bias in pre- trained models. Specifically, we empirically show that by fine-tuning a pre-trained model on only 10 de-biased (intervened) training exam- ples, the tendency to favor any gender is sig- nificantly reduced. Since our proposed method only needs a few training examples, our few- shot debiasing approach is highly feasible and practical. Through
In this paper, we show that simple data interventions on limited training data effectively reduce gender bias in LLMs. We also show that a biased pre- trained LLM can be used to mine the most effective de-biasing training examples. Evaluation of our methods on state-of-the-art bias benchmarks empir- ically suggests that our methods effectively reduce gender bias. Given that our methods can work in a few-shot manner and do not require any auxiliary model training, we hope that our work benefits

3. Tutoring machines, 1973 Games and drills, such as flash cards, have long been used to help students learn tough subjects. But the cognitive tutoring programs developed at Carnegie Mellon, beginning in the 1970s, did more than simply drill students on math problems. Cognitive tutors were able to adapt, presenting harder or easier problems as students learned or stumbled. Today, cognitive tutors teach subjects such as algebra to hundreds of thousands of students every year.
