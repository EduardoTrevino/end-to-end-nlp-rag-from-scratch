Question: Which conference is DIFFERENCE-MASKING published in?

Context: Paper title: 'Difference-Masking: Choosing What to Mask in Continued Pretraining' Published year: 2023 Publication venue or conference: Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing Authors: Sheryl Mathew, Louis-Philippe Morency, P. Liang, Leena Mathur, Syeda Nahida Akter, Mengrou Shou, Eric Nyberg, Alex Wilf Summary: Difference-Masking is introduced, a masking strategy that automatically chooses what to mask during continued pretraining by considering what makes a task domain
A detailed description of our implementation of DIFFERENCE-MASKING in the multimodal setting can be found in Appendix B, and our hyperparame- ters can be found in Appendix A.

5 Results and Discussion

5.1 Comparison with Baseline Approaches
In this paper, we propose DIFFERENCE- MASKING, a novel approach for automatically se- lecting what to mask during continued pretraining. Our strategy first identifies anchors that describe what makes a target domain different from the pre- training domain and then determines what to mask during continued pretraining based on similarity to those anchors.

work is required. Unlike a P hD defense, only a simple majority vote of the committee is

required for approval.
