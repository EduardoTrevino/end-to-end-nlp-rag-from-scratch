Question: How much increase in throughput (multi GPU setup) does SAMA showcase in large-scale meta learning benchmarks?

Context: scalability and the overall performance of SAMA on a multitude of large-scale meta learning benchmarks involving large language models (e.g., BERT [31] and RoBERTa [39]) or large datasets (e.g., ImageNet-1k [10]). Notably, SAMA showcases up to 1.7/4.8× increase in throughput and 2.0/3.8× decrease in memory consumption respectively on single-/multi-GPU setups compared to other baseline meta learning algorithms. In addition, we observe that SAMA- based data optimization consistently leads to
designed to flexibly support a broad range of adaptive optimizers in the base level of meta learning programs, while reducing computational burden by avoiding explicit computation of second-order gradient information, and exploiting efficient distributed training techniques implemented for first-order gradients. Evaluated on multiple large-scale meta learning benchmarks, SAMA showcases up to 1.7/4.8× increase in throughput and 2.0/3.8× decrease in memory consumption respectively on
single-/multi-GPU setups compared to other baseline meta learning algorithms. Furthermore, we show that SAMA-based data optimization leads to consistent improvements in text classification accuracy with BERT and RoBERTa large language models, and achieves state-of-the-art results in both small- and large-scale data pruning on image classification tasks, demonstrating the practical applicability of scalable meta learning across language and vision domains.
