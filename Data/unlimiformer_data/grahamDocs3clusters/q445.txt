Particularly, SPAR-wiki is an ensemble of two dense models with one pretrained using BM25 su- pervision on Wikipedia and the other fine-tuned on NQ. BM25 is included here, as it is found to achieve better performance than its dense counter- part on those two datasets. The evaluation results are shown in Table 5. Overall, our model achieves the largest gains over BM25 on both datasets, indi- cating that our multi-task fine-tuned model with Chain-of-Skills inference is more robust than previous

16. CAPTCHAs, 2000 “Spam” and malicious attacks were a growing problem on the Internet when hackers developed automated “bots” that could sign up for email and other Web services without human intervention. Luis von Ahn (CS’03,’05), Nick Hopper (CS’04), John Langford (CS’02) and CMU professor Manuel Blum invented a “Completely Automated Public Turing Test to tell Computers and Humans Apart,” or CAPTCHA, to help foil the bots. A later variation, reCAPTCHA, is helping digitize old books and
15. Model checking, 1994 CMU professor Edmund Clarke had long stressed the importance of verifying computer hardware and software through a formal problem-solving technique called “model checking.” In 1994, his arguments gained new weight with the discovery that Intel’s amazing new Pentium chip made errors on certain math problems. Clarke would go on to receive the Turing Award for his role in the development of model checking.
