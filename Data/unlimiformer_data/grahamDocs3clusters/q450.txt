Question: What type of requests will aligned text models refuse to answer?

Context: Large language models are now tuned to align with the goals of their creators, namely to be “helpful and harmless.” These models should respond helpfully to user questions, but refuse to answer requests that could cause harm. However, adversarial users can construct inputs which circumvent attempts at alignment. In this work, we study to what extent these models remain aligned, even when interacting with an adversarial user who constructs worst-case inputs (adversarial examples). These inputs
Non-Evasiveness Alignment Sometimes, due to iterative safety alignment training, the RLHF- trained model (e.g., LLaMA-2-Chat; Touvron et al. (2023b)) can be over-aligned such that it would incorrectly refuse to answer a question that it should, for example, due to overly broad instructions to be cautious in how it provides responses. In this work, we investigate whether it is possible to reduce the false refusal rates of these over-aligned AI agents by defining customized principles.
are designed to cause the model to emit harmful content that would otherwise be prohibited. We show that existing NLP-based optimiza- tion attacks are insufficiently powerful to reliably attack aligned text models: even when current NLP-based attacks fail, we can find adversarial inputs with brute force. As a result, the failure of current attacks should not be seen as proof that aligned text models remain aligned under adversarial inputs.
