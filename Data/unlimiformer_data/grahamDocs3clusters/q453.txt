Question: How does CSurF address sparse lexicon-based retrieval?

Context: Paper title: 'CSurF: Sparse Lexical Retrieval through Contextualized Surface Forms' Published year: 2023 Publication venue or conference: International Conference on the Theory of Information Retrieval Authors: Zhen Fan, Jamie Callan, Luyu Gao Summary: This paper proposes to directly bridge the surface form space and the term semantics space in lexical exact-match retrieval via contextualized surface forms (CSF), reaching comparable accuracy as lexical all-to-all soft match systems as an
Lexical Retrieval Lexical retrieval is a score func- tion for token matching calculated between two high-dimensional sparse vectors with token weights. BM25 (Robertson et al., 2009) is the most commonly used lexical retrieval function. We use the BM25 results reported in Thakur et al. (2021b) for comparison.
7.1.2 Depth Considerations for Recall-Oriented Evaluation. All of our recall-oriented evaluations (e.g. lexirecall, RP, R1000) suffer when operating within a shallow retrieval environment. We rec- ommend that, especially for recall-oriented evaluation, retrieval depths be high, regardless of the specific evaluation method. Moreover, as labels become sparser, both RP and R1000 show sub- stantially more ties (Figure 12) and poor robustness (Figure 13). We recommend that, for shallow retrieval
