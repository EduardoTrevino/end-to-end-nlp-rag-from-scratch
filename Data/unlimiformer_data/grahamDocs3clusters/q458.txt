Context: Paper title: 'WebArena: A Realistic Web Environment for Building Autonomous Agents' Published year: 2023 Publication venue or conference: arXiv.org Authors: Robert Lo, Frank F. Xu, Shuyan Zhou, Xuhui Zhou, Hao Zhu, Uri Alon, Daniel Fried, Abishek Sridhar, Graham Neubig, Yonatan Bisk, Xianyi Cheng Summary: This paper builds an environment for language-guided agents that is highly realistic and reproducible, and creates an environment with fully functional websites from four common domains:
We present WebArena, a highly-realistic, standalone, and reproducible web environment designed for the development and testing of autonomous agents. WebArena includes fully functional web applications and genuine data from four major categories, providing a realistic platform for agent interaction. It further supports a wide range of tools and external knowledge bases, fostering a focus on human-like problem-solving. Additionally, we curate a comprehensive benchmark consisting of 812 examples
Figure 1: WebArena is a standalone, self-hostable web environment for building autonomous agents. WebArena creates websites from four popular categories with functionality and data mimicking their real-world equivalents. To emulate human problem-solving, WebArena also embeds tools and knowledge resources as independent websites. WebArena introduces a benchmark on interpreting high-level realistic natural language command to concrete web-based interactions. We provide annotated programs designed
