Fig. 5 compares the confusion matrices obtained from six models. Each confusion matrix presents the number of true positives (TP), false positives (FP), false negatives (FN), and true negatives (TN) for binary classiﬁcation tasks. This study labels the classes ‘0’ for ‘Negative’ and ‘1’ for ‘Positive.’ The Switch Transformer model obtained the highest number of TP and TN, with 253 and 219, respectively. It misclassiﬁed 34 instances as false positives and 38 instances as false negatives.
