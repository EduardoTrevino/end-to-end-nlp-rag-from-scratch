Question: What does SYNTACC stand for from Alexander Waibel's paper?

Context: Thus, we also tried utilizing syntax as a proxy using Google Syntactic Ngrams biarcs (Goldberg and Orwant, 2013), as it is significantly larger. The biarcs portion of the corpus covers dependency relations between three connected content words, which includes transitive predicates. To calculate a similar ratio, we divide the number of times a noun occurs as a subject by the total number of subject and direct object occurrences (we call this the sub- ject ratio). A value closer to 1 should
