next. This departs from other current models that attempt, for example, to ground N400

ERP effects directly

from single-unit responses, with no causal-explanatory

mechanism

linking

them (Samimizad et al., 2022), or models

that relate

neurotransmitter profiles to the N400, without a mechanistic bridge tying together

these scales of analysis (Hagoort, 2013).

Eq. (2) encapsulates the recurrence relation of the S4 models (Gu et al., 2022; Gupta et al., 2022), S5 model (Smith et al., 2023), and Linear Recurrent Unit (Orvieto et al., 2023). For example, A is in the family of HiPPO matrix (Gu et al., 2023) in S4 or a complex diagonal matrix in Linear Recurrent Unit. We show in Proposition 1 that such input- independent A matrix cannot represent subtraction.

Proposition 1. An input-independent LRNN is in- consistent in representing subtraction.
