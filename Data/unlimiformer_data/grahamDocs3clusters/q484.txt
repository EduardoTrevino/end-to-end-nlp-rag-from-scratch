Question: What are the two steps in the PaintSeg painting process?

Context: Rainfall generation can be decomposed into two steps: a calibration step and a simulation step (as shown in Fig. 2). The calibration step serves to ﬁnd the set of parameters that best reproduces the statistical properties of the series given as an input or that best match the provided rainfall statistics. The simulation step takes a set of parameters as input and reproduces a time series of the process (punctual or spatial) that follows the supplied parameters. Additionally, the NEO- PRENE
Figure 1 illustrates our training procedure consisting of two steps. In Step 1, the student model is initialized from the teacher and is jointly distilled and pruned to generate a smaller model with a pre-specified size. In Step 2, the already pruned student model is further distilled to improve performance. In both steps, only unlabeled speech data are utilized and the teacher is frozen.
filled by repeating two steps: (1) sample the whole sequence ˆxptq from pθ given the non-masked tokens from the previous step, (2) re-mask the tλptq ¨ nu tokens in ˆxptq with the lowest probability, following a decreasing masking ratio schedule λptq, according to timestamp t. Denoising Diffusion Models (DDM). DDMs (Sohl-Dickstein et al., 2015; Song & Ermon, 2019) are regarded as the state-of-the-art in visual generation due to their high-quality image (Dhariwal & Nichol, 2021; Ho et al., 2022a)
