Question: In spring 2024, What is the course number for Generative AI?

Context: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) technology, exemplified by GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023) consoli- dates various tasks in natural language process- ing into a single sequence generation problem. This unified architecture enables users to complete multiple tasks (e.g., question answering (Thop- pilan et al., 2022), code generation (Chen et al., 2021), math problem solving (Lewkowycz et al., 2022), and scientific literature generation (Taylor et al., 2022)) through a natural language inter- face

Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) [Brown et al., 2020, Ramesh et al., 2022, Saharia et al., 2022, OpenAI, 2023a] has achieved significant progress in recent years, spanning from computer vision (CV) to natural language processing (NLP). Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT [OpenAI, 2022] can generate coherent and contextually relevant long-form text in response to user-specified prompts. However, the ease of using LLMs has raised concerns about their potential misuse [Zellers et

All Core courses are organized in sequence, and must be taken in the following order:

Artificial Intelligence and Future Markets (11-651) – No prerequisite.

AI Engineering (11-695) – Prerequisite is the co mpletion of 11-651 with a grade of “B” or

better.

LTI Practicum (11-935) – Three credit units for completing the required Internship.
