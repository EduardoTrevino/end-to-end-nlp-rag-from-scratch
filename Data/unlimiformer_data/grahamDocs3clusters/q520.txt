Context: [38] Irene Solaiman and Christy Dennison. Process for adapting language models to society (palms) with values-targeted datasets. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 34:5861– 5873, 2021.
Paper title: 'Generating Images with Multimodal Language Models' Published year: 2023 Publication venue or conference: arXiv.org Authors: Daniel Fried, R. Salakhutdinov, Jing Yu Koh Summary: This work proposes a method to fuse frozen text-only large language models (LLMs) with pre-trained image encoder and decoder models, by mapping between their embedding spaces, and exhibits a wider range of capabilities compared to prior multimodal language models.
