Jivko Sinapov1
We introduce MOSAIC (Multi-modal Object property learning with Self-Attention and Integrated Comprehension), an approach to acquire versatile representations adaptable to various interactive perception tasks within robotics. MO- SAIC is designed to extract unified multi-sensory object property representations, enabling understanding of object properties by leveraging diverse sensory modalities. This approach rests on the premise that natural language provides a versatile embedding space whose
