One major constraint was storage space. The audio used to train the HuBERT-Large model consumed over 7TB of disk space, with the majority from Libri-Light 60k [37].

To avoid this, we made significant modifications to the clustering pipeline. The k-means model was trained using features from LibriSpeech,

1948 – Design Competition (from the 1949 Thistle). Identified buggies: KapSig (3rd from the left, back row); PiKA (4th from the left, back row); Beta Sigma Rho (far left, back row). We also believe that the bottom buggy in the front row (3 wheels, no shell) belongs to Citcom Clan.

1948 – Hill 1 of the Finals (from the 1949 Thistle). KapSig in Lane 1 (left), DTD in Lane 2 (middle), PiKA in Lane 3 (right)
1947 – DU’s Flying Pork Barrel (with cowboy hat-adorning driver) being pushed on the Back Hills (from the 1948 Thistle). DU would go on to earn their first and only Buggy championship. The three wheeled buggy trailing appears to be DTD. This might be the Finals.

The starting line from the inaugural race in June 1920 was outside what is now known as the College of Fine Arts building. Racers then traveled toward Margaret Morrison Carnegie Hall, went up Tech Street, down through Schenley Park and then turned back to campus. Buggies would then take pit stops and have their rear wheels swapped before heading back toward the starting line.
