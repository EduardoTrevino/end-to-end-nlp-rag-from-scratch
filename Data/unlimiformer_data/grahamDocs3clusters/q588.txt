Question: What number do all of the LTI classes start with?

Context: xi is class 1 di −di xi is class 2

.

The equation 25 can be written as

Lt2l =

(cid:88)

yi=0

log(1 + e−mi) +

mie−mi/τ 1 + e−mi/τ

+

(cid:88)

yj =1

log(1 + emj ) −

mjemj /τ 1 + emj /τ

(26)

Let m∗ = min(mi) be the minimal margin, let N1 and N2 be the number of instances in class 1 and class 2 respectively which reaches the minimal margin. From the gradient analysis in equation 24, the examples with mi > m∗ has loss lower bounded by that with minimal margin. Then
1 1 + e−di 1 1 + e−di

P (ˆy1|xi; θ) =

P (ˆy1|xi; θ) = 1 −

In binary classiﬁcation, the margin is simply

margin =

(cid:40)

xi is class 1 di −di xi is class 2

For soft-label distribution Q,

1 1 + e−di/τ 1 1 + e−di/τ

Q(ˆy1|xi; θ) =

Q(ˆy1|xi; θ) = 1 −

Then Lt2l is derived as

Lt2l =

N (cid:88)

i=1

log(1 + e−di) +

die−di/τ 1 + e−di/τ

Calculate the derivative of Lt2l w.r.t di,

∂Lt2l ∂di

=

−die−di/τ t(e−di/τ + 1)2

+

e−di/τ − e−di (e−di/τ + 1)(e−di + 1)
Table 1 summarizes the extrapolation setting. We mostly follow the requirements in Deletang et al. (2023), where the training and extrapola- tion lengths are 40 and 500. The lengths for ModArith(5) are 39 and 499 because this task re- quires odd-length inputs.

by actual classroom courses, not credit given for research or independent study.

An “LTI course ” is any 12 -unit course with a number of 11 -XXX; a  6-unit course with 11 -XXX

counts as one- half of an LTI course. Unless otherwise specified, "course" means an actual

classroom course, not  credit given for research or independent study. Note that the LTI  allow s

any one MLD (10 -XXX) graduate course to count as an "LTI course".

4.4 Definitions of LTI Terminology

We define here some of the terms as used in this handbook:

An “LTI course” is any 12 -unit course with a number of 11 -XXX; a 6 -unit course with an

11-XXX counts as 1/2 of an LTI course. Unless otherwise specified, "course" means an

actual classroom course, not  credit given for research or independent study. Note that

we will allow any one MLD (10 -xxx) graduate- level course to count as an “LTI course.”
degree, the student must pass 96  or more course units of graduate courses, and meet the following

criteria:

At least 72 units of “LTI” courses and 24  units of “SCS” courses,

At least one class in each “LTI Focus Area”, and

At least two labs, in two different research areas .

For definitions of quoted terms, see the section on “Definitions of LTI Terminology”.

Unless approved by the Program Director in advance, the course requirements must be satisfied
