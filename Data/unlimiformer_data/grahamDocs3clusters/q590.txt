Question: In spring 2024, When do Mini-4 faculty course evaluations close?

Context: Sachan et al. (2022) evaluated their method using only QA (but not IR) datasets and their main results are for an impractically large three-billion parameter instruction-finetuned model, which was used essentially as a re-ranker (in a zero-shot scenario). The smallest model used by Sachan et al. (2022) had 250 million parameters (compared to our 30-million MiniLM model). It was evaluated only on the Natural Questions (NQ) collection (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019) where it outperformed BM25 by about
Mini GPT-4 [Zhu et al., 2023] uses a pretrained Q-Former module from [Li et al., 2023] to project images encoded by EVA CLIP ViT-G/14 [Fang et al., 2022] to Vicuna’s [Chiang et al., 2023] text embedding space. Both CLIP and Vicuna are frozen, while a section of the Q-former is finetuned on a subset of LAION [Schuhmann et al., 2021], Conceptual Captions [Sharma et al., 2018], SBU [Ordonez et al., 2011], and multimodal instruction-following data generated by the authors.
(Dai et al., 2023). Otter (Li et al., 2023b;a) focuses on enhancing OpenFlamingo’s instruction-following capability. MiniGPT-4 (Zhu et al., 2023) suggests GPT4’s prowess is due to sophisticated LLMs and recommends using a sin- gle project layer to align visual and linguistic models. It showcases abilities akin to GPT4 but is computationally efficient. mPLUG-Owl (Ye et al., 2023) offers a new approach: initially aligning
