Many existing speech translation benchmarks focus on native-English speech in high-quality recording conditions, which often do not match In this the conditions in real-life use-cases. paper, we describe our speech translation sys- tem for the multilingual track of IWSLT 2023, which evaluates translation quality on scientific conference talks. The test condition features accented input speech and terminology-dense contents. The task requires translation into 10 languages of varying amounts of
