For a detailed breakdown of the above requirements, download and read the PhD Handbook. Curriculum: In order to obtain your Ph.D. in Language and Information Technologies, you need to pass 96 units (generally, eight courses) of graduate courses that fulfill these requirements: At least 72 units of LTI courses: Must include one class in each LTI focus area. At least 24 units of SCS courses. At least two lab courses in two different research areas. Here's a sample of what your five-year schedule
In order to  complete the Master of Language Technologies degree, the student must pass 120

or more course units of senior- to-graduate courses, and meet the following criteria:

within those 120 units, at least 72 units of “LTI” courses and 24 units of “SCS” courses,

within those 72 units, 11 -711, 11- 791 (or an equivalent , see below ), and one ``Task

Orientation Focus'' class, and

within those 72 units, at least one of the following:

o an LTI lab course,

o 11-792, or
Requirements: Students interested in the language technologies minor must complete our prerequisite courses with an average grade of B (3.0) or better before applying to the program. (Students who do not meet this average must submit a letter of explanation along with their application.) Prerequisites include: - Principles of Imperative Computation (15-122) - Principles of Functional Programming (15-150)
