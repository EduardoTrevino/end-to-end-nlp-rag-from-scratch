Question: What is the target duration of the LTI PhD program in years?

Context: The duration of the learning rate increase is 10% of the whole training time, which is about 2 · 105 iterations. We train the network with a batch size of 15 (anchor, positive) pairs per iteration. During training, we set m = 0.5, τp = 2 m and τn = 80 m, and the distance function d(·) as the L2 distance.
Table 1 summarizes the extrapolation setting. We mostly follow the requirements in Deletang et al. (2023), where the training and extrapola- tion lengths are 40 and 500. The lengths for ModArith(5) are 39 and 499 because this task re- quires odd-length inputs.

000 problems each, with the same initial budget (2000 node expansions for Sokoban and The Witness, 7000 for STP) and stop as soon as the training set is entirely solved. Training LTS+CM for these domains took less than 2 hours each. Harder Sokoban. Additionally, we compare algorithms on the Boxoban ‘hard’ set of 3332 problems. Guez et al. [2019] trained a convLSTM network on the medium- difficulty dataset (450k problems) with a standard actor-critic setup — not the LTS loss — and used LTS

4.1 Duration of Study

The target duration of the LTI Ph.D.  is five years, although six years is also common.

Carnegie Mellon graduate students are expected to complete their degree requirements within the standard length of time for their program of study as outlined in this Graduate Student Handbook. Upon completion of the graduate program degree requirements, the degree will be certified by the student’s academic program in the semester in which the student completes the

requirements.
typically a 16-month program consisting of courses, seminars, a required Capstone Project and a required summer internship or practical training. While some MCDS graduates continue on to PhD programs in the LTI or other leading universities, most graduates go on to jobs in 7corporate research and development laboratories.
5.1 Graduate Student Funding

For all LTI Ph.D.  students, full funding (tuition plus stipend) is guaranteed for the first year . This

support is normally continued for at least 5 years, with possibility of further continuance, subject to continuing satisfactory progress and availability of funding. The fellowship includes full tuition

and fees, and a monthly Ph.D.  stipend that is fixed across SCS. In addition, the LTI pays a
