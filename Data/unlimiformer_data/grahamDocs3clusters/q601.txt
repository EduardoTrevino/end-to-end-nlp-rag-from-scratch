Language
Existing research classiﬁes world languages into Resource 0 to 5, with 0 having the lowest resource and 5 having the highest (Joshi et al., 2020). We choose 10 target languages ranging from Resource 0 to 5 (Table 2). For each target language we choose ten neighboring languages as source lan- guages (Table 2). We prioritize Resource 0 to 2 languages as real endangered languages, and we use Resource 3 to 5 languages as hypothetical ones. To translate into these languages, our text is the Bible in

Introduction

Despite the majority of the world’s languages be- ing low-resource, current MT systems still perform poorly on them or do not include them at all. Some commercial systems like Google Translate1 sup- port a number of LRLs, but many systems do not support any, and in either case the majority of LRLs are largely neglected in language technologies.
