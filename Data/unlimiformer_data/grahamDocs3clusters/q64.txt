Question: What are the two standard benchmarks used to evaluate the performance of FREDOM?

Context: In the generation task, models generate full-sentence answers given the question. The benchmark evaluates the model’s performance on both questions to measure truthful models and the intersection of truthful and informative. As shown in Table 4 (right), Dromedary achieves higher scores than GPT-3, LLaMA, Alpaca in both categories, while failing behind the ChatGPT-distilled Vicuna model.

4.2.2 BIG-bench HHH Eval
Evaluation Dataset To evaluate LLM’s performance on non-English languages, we use two benchmark cross-lingual datasets, XQUAD (Artetxe et al., 2020) and MLQA (Lewis et al., 2020), which requires the model to reason over the given context and answer the given question. In addi- tion, we create a new multilingual evaluation set MI-EVAL (introduced in Appendix B) to assess the capability of LLM in following multilingual instructions. These multilingual multi-way test sets also allow us to compare
Next, a major challenge is the significant variability of measuring performance on real hardware due to server workload and configuration issues. Indeed, we find that benchmarking on real hardware can lead to large, phantom performance “improvements” due only to random chance. To address this challenge, we evaluate performance using the gem5 CPU simulator (Binkert et al., 2011), the gold standard CPU simulator in academia and industry, and models state-of-the-art general-purpose processors.

graded on the 4.3 grading standard http://www.cmu.edu/policies/documents/Grades.html. MCDS students must maintain a 3.0 overall average each semester to remain in good standing. A student must obtain a B- or better grade in all courses, which count towards core requirements. If a student 19receives a C- or better, that course may count as an elective towards the degree requirements. All courses must receive a letter grade; courses taken pass/fail do not count towards the MCDS degree.
