Neural networks are powerful but their internal workings are infamously opaque. Recent work in mechanistic interpretability explains specific processes within language models (LMs) using circuit analysis (Wang et al., 2022; Hanna et al., 2023; Lieberum et al., 2023) which reverse-engineers small subnetworks that explain some behavior on a dataset. Through causal interventions, these studies are able to attribute interpretable roles for specific model components involved in predicting the
ABSTRACT Recent research has shown that training low-rank neural networks can effectively reduce the total number of trainable parameters without sacriﬁcing predictive accuracy, resulting in end-to-end speedups. However, low-rank model training necessitates adjusting several additional factorization hyperparameters, such as the rank of the factorization at each layer. In this paper, we tackle this challenge by introducing CUTTLEFISH, an automated low-rank training approach that eliminates the
