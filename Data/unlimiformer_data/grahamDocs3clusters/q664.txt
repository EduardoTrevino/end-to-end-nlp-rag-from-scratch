Question: Who is teaching the question answering course at LTI?

Context: The Domains of the Pile were then each separately ablated from pretraining to understand the effect of their absence. To evaluate their absence on the performance of downstream domains, we chose to use the question answering task expressly because there is a wide variety of similarly formatted evaluation datasets available. For these question answering datasets we train only on Natural Questions (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019), a popular QA dataset, to teach the model the general task. For

standard course, because they provide a good introduction to the broad range of research done at

the LTI. Students do not register for the LTI Orientation, nor do they receive a grade; however, the department is serious about its expectation that new students will attend these talks.

For many years, these talks were called "the Immigration Course (IC)." The intuition behind this

name is that the talks help orient newly -arrived students – immigrants into the CMU

A “Task -Orientation Focus Course ” is a course belonging to that LTI Focus Area, as listed on
