Question: What are some of the metrics incorporated in Pentathlon for efficiency evaluation?

Context: Comprehensive metrics (§2.3): Pentathlon evaluates models with five crucial metrics, including throughput, latency, memory overhead, the number of parameters, and energy consumption, hence the name Pentathlon. This provides a more holistic understanding of a model’s efficiency.
progress in real-world applications. In response, we introduce efficiency Pentathlon, a benchmark for holistic and realistic evaluation of model efficiency. Pentathlon focuses on inference, which accounts for a majority of the compute in a model’s lifecycle. It offers a strictly-controlled hardware platform, and is designed to mirror real-world applications scenarios. It incorporates a suite of metrics that target different aspects of efficiency, including latency, throughput, memory overhead,
Figure 1: By submitting to Pentathlon, practition- ers can compare their models against all previous submissions on identical hardware, eliminating the need to re-implement previous works and substan- tially reducing the workloads for fair efficiency comparisons. Models are evaluated in four real- istic scenarios designed to mirror real-world ap- plications. Our platform evaluates the submission across five crucial efficiency metrics, including throughput, latency, memory overhead, the num- ber
