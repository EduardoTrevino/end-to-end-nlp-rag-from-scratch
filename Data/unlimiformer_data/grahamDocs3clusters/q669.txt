Question: How many parameters does the chain-of-skills model have?

Context: In this work, we propose a modular model Chain-of-Skills (COS) learns five reusable skills for ODQA via multi-task learning. To reduce task interference, we design a new pa- rameterization for skill modules. We also show that skills learned by COS can be flexibly chained to- gether to better fit the target task. COS can directly perform superior zero-shot retrieval using multi- task self-supervision on Wikipedia. When fine- tuned on multiple datasets, COS achieves SOTA results across the board.
Figure 2: Chain-of-Skills (COS) model architecture with three different query types. The left blue box indicates the single retrieval query input. The middle green box is the expanded query retrieval input based on the single retrieval results. The right orange case is the entity-centric query with “deep learning” as the targeted entity.
Chain-of-Skills inference, the naive configuration model shows severe degrada- tion caused by task interference compared with the multi-hop retriever, validating the effective- ness of our proposed model. We further com- pare our Chain-of-Skills inference with the retrieval-only inference on NQ, EntityQuestions and SQuAD in Figure 4. It is easy to see that our pretraining can benefit the retrieval-only ver- sion. However, using better skill configurations via Chain-of-Skills inference yields
