ABSTRACT
This paper details a case study on cocktail party speech recog- nition. Instead of recognizing all speakers, our system focuses on enhancing the target speaker’s voice before conducting speech recognition. Through rigorous experiments, we show- cased the effectiveness of our improved end-to-end model. Noteworthy enhancements include a cross-extraction speaker encoder, an improved mask estimation model, and an opti- mized loss function. We also publicly share our pre-trained ConVoiFilter to
This paper presents an end-to-end model designed to im- prove automatic speech recognition (ASR) for a particular speaker in a crowded, noisy environment. The model utilizes a single-channel speech enhancement module that isolates the speaker’s voice from background noise (ConVoiFilter) and an ASR module. The model can decrease ASR’s word error rate (WER) from 80% to 26.4% through this approach. Typically, these two components are adjusted independently due to vari- ations in data requirements.

At least two LTI faculty members will attend the presentation, including the research advisor.

After the presentation, these faculty members will convene and provide written feedback to both the student and the Program Director  of graduate programs (the form for this is available on the

LTI website). This feedback will help the student refine speaking skills with respect to talk

structure, content,  and delivery.

3.2 Advising
dialogue systems, information retrieval, machine translation, speech processing,  video

understanding, multimodal systems, automated reasoning, and other topics related to analysis

and understanding of unstructured information  (e.g., machine learning, and software engineering

of intelligent systems).
