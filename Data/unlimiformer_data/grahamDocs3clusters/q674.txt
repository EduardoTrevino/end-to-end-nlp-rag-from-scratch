Question: In spring 2024, When are Mid-Semester and Mini-3 grades due?

Context: Mini GPT-4 [Zhu et al., 2023] uses a pretrained Q-Former module from [Li et al., 2023] to project images encoded by EVA CLIP ViT-G/14 [Fang et al., 2022] to Vicunaâ€™s [Chiang et al., 2023] text embedding space. Both CLIP and Vicuna are frozen, while a section of the Q-former is finetuned on a subset of LAION [Schuhmann et al., 2021], Conceptual Captions [Sharma et al., 2018], SBU [Ordonez et al., 2011], and multimodal instruction-following data generated by the authors.
Sachan et al. (2022) evaluated their method using only QA (but not IR) datasets and their main results are for an impractically large three-billion parameter instruction-finetuned model, which was used essentially as a re-ranker (in a zero-shot scenario). The smallest model used by Sachan et al. (2022) had 250 million parameters (compared to our 30-million MiniLM model). It was evaluated only on the Natural Questions (NQ) collection (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019) where it outperformed BM25 by about
Not only were we able to reproduce key findings from prior work (Bonifacio et al., 2022), but, combining the original InPars recipe (Bonifacio et al., 2022) with (1) fine-tuning on consistency-checked data (Dai et al., 2022) and (2) all-domain pretraining, we trained an efficient yet small model MiniLM-L6-30M consistently outperforming BM25 in the unsupervised setting. In the same scenario, using a larger DeBERTA-v3-435M model, we largely matched performance of a 7x larger monoT5-3B.
