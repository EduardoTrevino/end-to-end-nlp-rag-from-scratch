Question: What is the BERTScore achieved by BASS-adapt on the How-2 test set?

Context: ﬁne-tuned BERTurk model using either the cross-encoder or a bi-encoder architecture. The ﬁne-tuning is done on the Turkish Natural Language Inference and Semantic Textual Similarity benchmark datasets. We show that these measures have better correlations with human evaluations compared to Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation (ROUGE) scores and BERTScore. We then introduce a deep reinforcement learning algorithm that uses the proposed semantic similarity measures as rewards,
BERTScore (Zhang et al., 2020a) embeds the generated utterances and the reference with word vectors using the BERT model and computes pair- wise cosine similarity for each generated word vec- tor and each word in the reference, then the recall of the generated sequences is calculated. BERTScore is distinct from the previous two metrics in that it computes similarity across semantic space and has been shown to have a strong correlation with human judgment at the segment level.
story to be predicted. There are 90,000 samples in the train set, and 4081 samples in the validation and test sets. The generation quality is evaluated based on ROUGE (Lin, 2004) and BERTScore metrics. A vocabulary of 25,000 BPE units is used in this task.

8. User interfaces, 1983 Why should humans adapt to fit computers? Shouldn’t computers adapt to fit humans? That was the attitude of CMU researchers, who applied design principles to computer science to develop better, easier-to-use interfaces. They called the new field “human-computer interaction.”
25. Smart, adaptable traffic signals, 2012 Smart traffic lights developed at CMU’s Robotics Institute are saving time and energy, and cutting down on the amount of air pollution created by idling cars. First rolled out in Pittsburgh’s East Liberty neighborhood, the new signals are being studied around the country.
