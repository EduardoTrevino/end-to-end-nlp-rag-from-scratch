Question: In spring 2024, What is the voucher deadline for Mini-3?

Context: Mini GPT-4 [Zhu et al., 2023] uses a pretrained Q-Former module from [Li et al., 2023] to project images encoded by EVA CLIP ViT-G/14 [Fang et al., 2022] to Vicuna’s [Chiang et al., 2023] text embedding space. Both CLIP and Vicuna are frozen, while a section of the Q-former is finetuned on a subset of LAION [Schuhmann et al., 2021], Conceptual Captions [Sharma et al., 2018], SBU [Ordonez et al., 2011], and multimodal instruction-following data generated by the authors.
which are presented in § A.3 Table 5. For MiniLM-L6-30M, the all-domain pre-training improves the best-seed accuracy in all cases. For DeBERTA-v3-435M, there is either a substantial degradation or a small decrease/increase that is not statistically significant (denoted by super-script label “c”). Thus, our biggest model—unlike a 15x smaller MiniLM-L6-30M—does not benefit from all-domain pretraining. However, there is no substantial degradation either.
Not only were we able to reproduce key findings from prior work (Bonifacio et al., 2022), but, combining the original InPars recipe (Bonifacio et al., 2022) with (1) fine-tuning on consistency-checked data (Dai et al., 2022) and (2) all-domain pretraining, we trained an efficient yet small model MiniLM-L6-30M consistently outperforming BM25 in the unsupervised setting. In the same scenario, using a larger DeBERTA-v3-435M model, we largely matched performance of a 7x larger monoT5-3B.
