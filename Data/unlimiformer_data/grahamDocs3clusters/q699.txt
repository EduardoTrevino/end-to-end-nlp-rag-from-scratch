TTS on real-world speech. An approach to using real- world speech for TTS is to incorporate denoising. Recent work (Zhang et al. 2021) trained the denoising module and the TTS system jointly with external noise data. Our work focuses on the TTS system itself instead of explicit noise modeling, and we utilize a simple audio prompt for noise reduction without additional training. There is also re- search (Yan et al. 2021) focusing on modeling characteris- tics of spontaneous speech, such as ﬁlled

9. Machine translation, 1984 Every “Star Trek” fan knows about the universal translator. Scientists in the Language Technologies Institute are moving those gadgets from science fiction to real life. Their pioneering systems include handheld, portable speech-to-speech translators, just like those depicted on the USS Enterprise.
