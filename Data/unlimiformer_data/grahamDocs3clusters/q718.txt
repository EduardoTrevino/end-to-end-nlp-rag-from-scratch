Abstract
to predict AMs from phonemes. In this way, we can quantitatively analyze the relationship between each facial AM and phoneme pairs. In this paper, we aim to answer core two questions: 1) whether there exists any “enig- matic” link between phoneme and facial features and 2) whether those “enigmatic” links can be quantitatively described.

16. CAPTCHAs, 2000 “Spam” and malicious attacks were a growing problem on the Internet when hackers developed automated “bots” that could sign up for email and other Web services without human intervention.

A later variation, reCAPTCHA, is helping digitize old books and
