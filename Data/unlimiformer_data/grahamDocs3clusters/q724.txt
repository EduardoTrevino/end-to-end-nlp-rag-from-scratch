Question: How many months is the shorter track of the MIIS program?

Context: The details of the training process are as follows. We started ﬁne-tuning the mT5, by mini- mizing the maximum-likelihood loss for 15 epochs, using a batch size of 8, accumulation steps of 4, and learning rate of 10e-5 with Adafactor optimization and cosine annealing learning rate decay schedule (Loshchilov and Hutter 2016). The maximum news length was set to 512 and max- imum summary length was determined as 120. We initialized our reinforcement learning models with the ﬁne-tuned models that
As we work collaboratively on such projects, we’ve been struck by the open-endedness the short-form method produces, with substantial implications for oral and public histor- ical practice. In a 1 or 2-minute PixStori, many respondents take only 15 or 20 seconds to literally describe and context the actual photograph. And then, more characteristically, they “take off” to a broader story or reflection sparked by the photo – resulting in anec- dotes or commentaries that are “grounded but not
We estimate the total GPU time for results presented in this paper did not exceed approximately 116 days of time on a single 48-GB A6000. The longest-training models, SLED and retrieval training for GovReport, took approximately 10 days to train.

Option 1. Standard MIIS degree  (MIIS -16) - A 16 -month track that is completed in three

academic semesters (fall, spring, fall) and a summer internship.

Option 2. MIIS: Advanced Study degree  (MIIS -21) - A 21 -month track that is completed in

four academic semesters (fall, spring, fall, spring) and a summer internship.

MIIS: Advanced Study track offers in depth  degree in one of the following areas of
