Question: What are some diffusion models mentioned in the document, "Extracting Training Data from Diffusion Models"?

Context: Paper title: 'Extracting Training Data from Diffusion Models' Published year: 2023 Publication venue or conference: USENIX Security Symposium Authors: Daphne Ippolito, Florian Tramèr, B. Balle, Milad Nasr, Matthew Jagielski, Eric Wallace, Nicholas Carlini, Vikash Sehwag, Jamie Hayes Summary: The results show that diffusion models are much less private than prior generative models such as GANs, and that mitigating these vulnerabilities may require new advances in privacy-preserving training.
Nicholas, Jamie, Vikash, and Eric each indepen- dently proposed the problem statement of extracting training data from diffusion models.

Nicholas, Eric, and Florian performed preliminary experiments to identify cases of data extraction in diffusion models.

Milad performed most of the experiments on Stable Diffusion and Imagen, and Nicholas counted dupli- cates in the LAION training dataset; each wrote the corresponding sections of the paper.
Figure 8: Selected training examples that we extract from a diffusion model trained on CIFAR-10 by sampling from the model 1 million times. Top row: generated output from a diffusion model. Bottom row: nearest ((cid:96)2) example from the training dataset. Figure 17 in the Appendix contains all 1,280 unique extracted images.
