RQ2: Zero-Shot Transfer to Chinese Vision-Language Tasks We assess models on three unseen Chinese vision-language tasks to investigate the cross-language generalization capabilities of instruc- tion tuning. BLIP-2 is not considered, as Flan-T5 does not support Chinese.2 As illustrated in Table 5, our model outperforms MiniGPT4 and InstructBLIP on all evaluated tasks, demonstrating notable improvements. These findings indicate that instruction tuning with English datasets can effectively
Text language models have shown remarkable zero-shot capability in generalizing to unseen tasks when provided with well-formulated instructions. However, existing studies in speech processing primar- ily focus on limited or speciﬁc tasks. Moreover, the lack of stan- dardized benchmarks hinders a fair comparison across different ap- proaches. Thus, we present Dynamic-SUPERB, a benchmark de- signed for building universal speech models capable of leveraging instruction tuning to perform multiple
