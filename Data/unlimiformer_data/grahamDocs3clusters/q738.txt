6.2 FINAL MODEL

Based on the insights from the architecture and dataset ablations, we train a ﬁnal model, which we call SantaCoder, with MQA and FIM and the two data ﬁlters that yielded the best results: more near- deduplication and comments-to-code ﬁlter. We train this model for 600K iterations (236B tokens) and keep all other hyper-parameters the same.
