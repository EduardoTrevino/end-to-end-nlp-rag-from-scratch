Question: What are the three aspects assessed by the holistic evaluation in MultiZoo & MultiBench?

Context: In this section, we outline the design principles and process of evaluating multi-modal LLMs (i.e., AudioGPT). Speciﬁcally, we evaluate the LLMs in the following three aspects: 1) Consistency, which measures whether the LLMs properly understand the intention of a user, and assigns the audio foundation models closely aligned with human cognition and problem-solving; 2) Capabilitity, which measures the performance of audio foundation models in handling complex audio tasks, understanding and
We present Pentathlon, a benchmark for holistic and realistic evaluation of inference efficiency. Pentathlon targets multiple aspects of efficiency including latency, throughput, memory overhead, number of parameters, and energy consumption, on a strictly-controlled hardware platform. Inte- grating evaluation with Pentathlon is seamless and can drastically reduce the workload to make fair and reproducible efficiency comparisons. Pentathlon offers both testing in real-world application scenarios
