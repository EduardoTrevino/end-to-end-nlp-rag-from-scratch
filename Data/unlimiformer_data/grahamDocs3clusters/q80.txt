Question: In spring 2024, What is the deadline for adding or dropping a Mini-4 course with tuition adjustment?

Context: Mini GPT-4 [Zhu et al., 2023] uses a pretrained Q-Former module from [Li et al., 2023] to project images encoded by EVA CLIP ViT-G/14 [Fang et al., 2022] to Vicuna’s [Chiang et al., 2023] text embedding space. Both CLIP and Vicuna are frozen, while a section of the Q-former is finetuned on a subset of LAION [Schuhmann et al., 2021], Conceptual Captions [Sharma et al., 2018], SBU [Ordonez et al., 2011], and multimodal instruction-following data generated by the authors.

A SOURCE OF MULTIMODAL HALLUCINATION
The details of the training process are as follows. We started ﬁne-tuning the mT5, by mini- mizing the maximum-likelihood loss for 15 epochs, using a batch size of 8, accumulation steps of 4, and learning rate of 10e-5 with Adafactor optimization and cosine annealing learning rate decay schedule (Loshchilov and Hutter 2016). The maximum news length was set to 512 and max- imum summary length was determined as 120. We initialized our reinforcement learning models with the ﬁne-tuned models that
