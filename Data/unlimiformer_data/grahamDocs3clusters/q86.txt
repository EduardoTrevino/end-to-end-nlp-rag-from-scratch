Question: In the Convoifilter paper, what is the WER achieved by the joint fine-tuning strategy?

Context: However, speech enhancement can create anomalies that decrease ASR efficiency. By imple- menting a joint fine-tuning strategy, the model can reduce the WER from 26.4% in separate tuning to 14.5% in joint tun- ing. We openly share our pre-trained model to foster further research hf.co/nguyenvulebinh/voice-filter.
2.3. Joint fine-tuning strategy
multi-task pretrained retriever achieves superior zero-shot performance compared to re- cent state-of-the-art (SOTA) self-supervised dense retrievers and BM25 (Robertson and Zaragoza, 2009). When fine-tuned using multiple datasets jointly, COS can further benefit from high-quality supervision effectively, leading to new SOTA re- trieval results across the board. Further analy- ses show the benefits of our modularization pa- rameterization for multi-task pretraining and fine- tuning, as well as

Important Note: MCDS implements the above policy’s option of “conven[ing] a disciplinary hearing according to the procedures of the department/program”. We have adopted the following hearing procedure and “two strikes” rule:  If an instructor determines that an academic integrity violation has occurred, both the instructor and students are given the opportunity to explain the situation to the MCDS program committee. A written hearing by email suffices for this purpose.  The program committee

It is a violation of academic integrity for you to assist anyone else in violating the policy or to
