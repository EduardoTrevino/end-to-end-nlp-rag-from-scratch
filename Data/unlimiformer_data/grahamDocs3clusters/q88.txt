Text Games Text-based games are complex, interac- tive simulations where the game state and action space are in natural lanugage. They are fertile ground for language-focused machine learning research. In addi- tion to language understanding, successful play requires skills like memory and planning, exploration (trial and error), and common sense. The AlfWorld (Shridhar et al., 2020b) simulator extends a common text-based game simulator, TextWorld Cˆot´e et al. (2018a), to create text-based
text classiﬁcation, their effectiveness is inﬂuenced by the data’s language and the training dataset’s size and quality.

Information retrieval, machine translation and speech technology are used daily by the general public, while text mining, natural language processing and language-based tutoring are common within more specialized professional or educational environments. The LTI prepares students for this world by offering a minor that gives you the opportunity to not only learn about language technologies, but to also apply that knowledge through a directed project.
