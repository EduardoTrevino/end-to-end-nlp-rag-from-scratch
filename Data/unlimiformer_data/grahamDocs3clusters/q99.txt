Question: Is there a limit on the number of guests who can attend the main commencement ceremony?

Context: So, to make sure that any person can serve as a supervisor of such lower-level group, we need to make sure that this group contains no more than 5 people – otherwise people who can only keep 5 ideas in their mind at the same time will not be able to effectively supervise this group.

On the other hand, everyone can keep 5 ideas, so it will be a waste of resources to make these primary groups with fewer then 5 folks.

Thus, the ideal size of the primary group is 5.
qualification questions during the task stage, our user study has 454 remaining participants.
How many primary groups should we combine into a secondary one? It is much more difﬁcult to be a boss of bosses than simply a low-level boss of people. Because of this increased difﬁculty, the number of primary groups combined into a secondary group should be smaller than 5 – the number of people in each primary group. So, we have 3 options:

we can have 4 groups of 5, making up 20 – which explains the base-20 system; actually, the Mayans explicitly considered 20 as 4 groups of 5;
