Surveying (Dis)Parities and Concerns of Compute Hungry NLP Research
surveys that investigate In this work, we provide a first at- them. tempt to quantify these concerns regarding three topics, namely, environmental impact, equity, and impact on peer reviewing. By conducting a survey with 312 participants from the NLP community, we capture exist- ing (dis)parities between different and within groups with respect to seniority, academia, and industry; and their impact on the peer re- viewing process. For each topic, we provide an analysis and devise
