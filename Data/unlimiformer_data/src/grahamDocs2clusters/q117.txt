capstone planning seminar (6 units). The capstone requirement gives students

experience with collaborative, team -oriented software development; significant hands -

on experience with the techniques studied in the classroom; and an opportunity to work on a large software application.
a. The capstone project (36 units) is a large, group- oriented demonstration of

student skill in one or more areas covered by the degree. Typically,  the result of

the capstone project is a major software application. The capstone project is

supervised by a member of the faculty who meets with students on a weekly

basis to monitor progress and provide guidance. MIIS Graduate Student Handbook  Page 17

b. The capstone planning seminar (6 units) organizes students into groups; defines
Pass/fail grades are not permitted for courses used to satisfy a degree requirement, except for

the 11 -696 (A) Capstone Planning Seminar and 11 -935 (R) LTI Practicum that are a Pass/Fail. MIIS Graduate Student Handbook  Page 21
