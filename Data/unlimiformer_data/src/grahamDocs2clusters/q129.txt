2.1 MULTIMODAL RLHF

Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) (Ziegler et al., 2019; Stiennon et al., 2020; Ouyang et al., 2022; Bai et al., 2022a) has emerged as a powerful and scalable strategy for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values. In this work, we use RLHF to align LMMs. The basic pipeline of our multimodal RLHF can be summarized into three stages:
15. Model checking, 1994 CMU professor Edmund Clarke had long stressed the importance of verifying computer hardware and software through a formal problem-solving technique called “model checking.” In 1994, his arguments gained new weight with the discovery that Intel’s amazing new Pentium chip made errors on certain math problems. Clarke would go on to receive the Turing Award for his role in the development of model checking.
