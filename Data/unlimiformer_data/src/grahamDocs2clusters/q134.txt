Question: Which populations were found to be predominantly aligned with by the datasets and models in the NLPositionality study?

Context: for an NLP task. We apply NLPosition- ality to two tasks, social acceptability and hate speech detection, to show that models and datasets have a positionality and design biases by aligning better with Western, White, college-educated, and younger populations. Our results indicate the need for more inclusive models and datasets, paving the way for NLP research that benefits all people.
predominantly with Western, White, college-educated, and younger popula- tions. Additionally, certain groups, such as non- binary people and non-native English speakers, are further marginalized by datasets and mod- els as they rank least in alignment across all tasks. Finally, we draw from prior literature to discuss how researchers can examine their own positionality and that of their datasets and models, opening the door for more inclusive NLP systems.
