Specifically, we choose KILT (Petroni et al.) as our multi-task data source, which consists of 5 categories (Fact Checking, En- tity Linking, Slot Filling, Open Domain QA, and Dialogue). We take one representative subtask per category to form a mixture of multiple source tasks. Figure 7 illustrates that ANCE trained with multi-task KILT can consistently

The Kiltie Band is a campus organization recognized by Student Senate and administered by the Department of Athletics, Physical Education and Recreation. Membership is open to all members of the campus/community without audition. Participants must do their best to promote the success of the ensemble through attendance, attitude, and dependability.
The Kiltie Marching Band consists of musicians and colorguard and plays at all Carnegie Mellon home football games. There is a new show every week with music ranging from traditional marches and oldies to current pop tunes and jazz standards.

After football season, the Kiltie Concert Band plays a holiday concert and two spring concerts, including a performance at Carnegie Mellonâ€™s Spring Carnival. Additionally, a part of the band gets together and acts as a pep band for the basketball teams.
