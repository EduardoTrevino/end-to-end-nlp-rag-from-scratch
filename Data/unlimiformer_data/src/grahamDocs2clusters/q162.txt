Question: What types of information does FiT5 integrate into a single unified model?

Context: Common IR pipelines are typically cascade sys- tems that may involve multiple rankers and/or fusion models to integrate different informa- tion step-by-step. In this paper, we propose a novel re-ranker named Fusion-in-T5 (FiT5), which integrates document text information, retrieval features, and global document in- formation into a single unified model using templated-based input and global attention. Ex- periments on passage ranking benchmarks MS MARCO and TREC DL show that FiT5 sig-
In this paper, we introduce Fusion-in-T5 (FiT5), a T5-based (Raffel et al., 2020) re-ranking model that collects ranking signals and ranks documents within a unified framework. FiT5 is designed to consolidate multiple IR features, including doc- ument texts, ranking features, and global docu- ment information, into a single learnable model. Specifically, the input to FiT5 is formulated us- ing a template that incorporates the document text with the ranking feature, which is represented as
FiT5 performs re-ranking on a set of candidate doc- uments D = {d1, d2, ..., dn} retrieved by a first- stage retriever, given a query q. Unlike typical re-ranking models which calculate si solely based on the query and one document text, denoted as si = f (q, di), FiT5 goes beyond the approach by further incorporating the ranking feature ri and the information from all the documents in D, which can be formulated as si = f (q, di, ri, D).
systems. Our comprehensive curriculum equips you with the skills and knowledge to develop the layers of technology involved in the next generation of massive information system deployments and analyze the data these systems generate. When you graduate, youâ€™ll have a unified vision of these systems from your core courses; internship experience; and semester-long, group-oriented capstone project.
