Question: What can be used to attack multimodal models that allow users to provide images?

Context: However the recent trend in large-scale ML models is multimodal models that allow users to provide images that influence the text that is generated. We show these models can be easily attacked, i.e., induced to perform arbitrary un-aligned behavior through adversarial perturbation of the input image. We conjecture that improved NLP attacks may demonstrate this same level of adversarial control over text-only models. Warning: some content generated by language models in this paper may be
Our attack approach directly follows the standard methodology for generating adversarial examples on image models. We construct an end-to-end differentiable implementation of the multimodal model, from the image pixels to the output logits of the language model. We apply standard teacher- forcing optimization techniques when the target suffix is > 1 token. To initiate each attack, we use a random image generated by sampling each pixel uniformly at random.

We then turn our attention to today’s most advanced multimodal models, such as OpenAI’s GPT-4 and Google’s Flamingo and Gemini, which accept both text and images as input [OpenAI, 2023, Alayrac et al., 2022, Pichai, 2023]. Specifically, we study open-source implementations with similar capabilities [Liu et al., 2023, Zhu et al., 2023, Gao et al., 2023] since these proprietary models are not publicly accessible. We find that we can use the continuous-domain images as adversarial prompts to cause
