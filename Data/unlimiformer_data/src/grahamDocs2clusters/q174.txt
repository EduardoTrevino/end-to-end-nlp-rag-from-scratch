Question: At what conference was "BASS: Block-wise Adaptation for Speech Summarization" published?

Context: In this paper, we described our systems for the mul- tilingual speech translation track of IWSLT 2023, which translates English speech into 10 target lan- guages. To tackle the task of translating scien- tific conference talks, which feature non-native in- put speech and terminology-dense contents, our systems have several novelties. Lacking suitable training data for the target domain, we used kNN- MT for inference-time adaptation and showed an improvement of +0.8 BLEU for cascaded speech
Paper title: 'Structured Pruning of Self-Supervised Pre-Trained Models for Speech Recognition and Understanding' Published year: 2023 Publication venue or conference: IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing Authors: Yifan Peng, Kwangyoun Kim, Felix Wu, Shinji Watanabe, Prashant Sridhar Summary: This work proposes three task-specific structured pruning methods to deal with heterogeneous speech models that not only utilize a stack of Transformer blocks, but also
