Fusion-in-T5: Unifying Document Ranking Signals for Improved Information Retrieval
In this paper, we propose Fusion-in-T5 (FiT5), which collects and unifies IR features on the re- ranking stage. We conduct experiments on MS MARCO and TREC DL, demonstrating FiT5â€™s ad- vantage in effectiveness. In addition, we provide an analytical demonstration to show the rationale of the effectiveness of FiT5 in incorporating global document information and ranking features.
