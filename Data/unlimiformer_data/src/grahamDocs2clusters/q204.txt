Question: What pre-trained model does MOSAIC leverage knowledge from?

Context: unified multi-sensory object property representations. While it is undeniable that visual information plays a prominent role, we acknowledge that many fundamental object properties extend beyond the visual domain to encompass attributes like texture, mass distribution, or sounds, which significantly influence how we interact with objects. In MOSAIC, we leverage this profound insight by distilling knowledge from the extensive pre-trained Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model,
data obtained through robotic object exploration. MOSAIC accomplishes this by distilling knowledge from the extensive pre-trained CLIP text model. To test our learned unified representations, we rely on a dataset where a robot engages with 100 objects, executing 10 exploratory behaviors while recording multiple sensory signals. The robot tackles two tasks reliant on perceiving object properties: object catego- rization and the fetch object task. The results highlight the ef- ficiency of our

These acquired representations are subsequently applied to a variety of downstream tasks.
