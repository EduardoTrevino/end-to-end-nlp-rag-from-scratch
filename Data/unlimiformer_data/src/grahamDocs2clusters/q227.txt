Question: What is the MOS-Q achieved by the MQTTS quantizer with a code size of 1024, on the VoxCeleb test set?

Context: Speaker Similarity Score (SSS). In multi-speaker TTS, it is also important to evaluate how well the synthesizer transfers speaker characteristics. Here we use the cosine

5.1 Quantizer Analysis Table 1 shows the reconstruction quality of the quantizer. From RCER, it is clear that using a single codebook (N = 1) drastically distorts the input phone sequence. Their distinc- tive low MOS-Q and MOS-N scores also suggest that N = 1 is not sufﬁcient to generate high-quality and natural speech. Even if we span a much larger codebook size, 65536, there is almost no difference compared to the 1024 codes across all metrics. This result indicates the necessity of having
speech quality (MOS-Q). For the remain- der of our experiments, we use N = 4 with a 160 code size, as we observe little perceptible quality and intelligibility dif- ference when we increase from N = 4 to 8.
