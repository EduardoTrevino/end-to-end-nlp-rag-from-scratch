Question: Who is the first author of the paper BASS: Block-wise Adaptation for Speech Summarization?

Context: Paper title: 'Regularizing Self-training for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation via Structural Constraints' Published year: 2023 Publication venue or conference: arXiv.org Authors: Emma Strubell, Rajshekhar Das, Jean Oh, Jose Moura, Jonathan M Francis, Sanket Vaibhav Mehta Summary: The regularizer significantly improves top performing self-training methods in various UDA benchmarks for semantic segmentation and introduces a contrastive pixel-level objectness constraint that pulls the pixel

Paper title: 'Augmentation-Adapted Retriever Improves Generalization of Language Models as Generic Plug-In' Published year: 2023 Publication venue or conference: Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics Authors: Zichun Yu, S. Yu, Chenyan Xiong, Zhiyuan Liu Summary: This paper proposes augmentation-adapted retriever (AAR), which learns LM’s preferences obtained from a known source LM to assist target LMs that may not be known beforehand or are unable to be fine-tuned
4. Speech recognition, 1976 If you have an iPhone, ask Siri to look up “Hearsay I,” the first computer system capable of continuous speech recognition. It was developed by future Turing Award winner and future SCS dean Raj Reddy along with his students. Their work on subsequent systems established many of the principles that still underlie speech recognition software.
