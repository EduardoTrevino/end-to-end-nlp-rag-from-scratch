Question: What is the name of the method introduced in "Semantic Pyramid AutoEncoder for Multimodal Generation"?

Context: Paper title: 'SPAE: Semantic Pyramid AutoEncoder for Multimodal Generation with Frozen LLMs' Published year: 2023 Publication venue or conference: arXiv.org Authors: Lu Jiang, Wolfgang Macherey, A. Hauptmann, David A. Ross, Irfan Essa, K. Murphy, Vivek Kumar, Ming Yang, Yonatan Bisk, Yong Cheng, Lijun Yu, Zhiruo Wang, Yanping Huang Summary: This method marks the first successful attempt to enable a frozen LLM to generate image content while surpassing state-of-the-art performance in image
proposed a deep learning based approach to repair fa¸cade defect textures from easily accessible semantic label map. Speciﬁcally, we proposed a semantics recovery method by using image completion algorithm to improve automation of de-occlusion. A regularity-aware multi-domain universal image translation method is used to synthesize building fa¸cade textures of arbitrary styles. This method achieves better results by enriching the details and improving the regularity of synthesized images.
The two main architectures that are ﬁne-tuned to predict sentence pair scoring tasks are cross- encoders and bi-encoders, illustrated in Fig. 1. In the cross-encoder approach, two sentences are passed simultaneously to the transformer network, which directly computes their semantic sim- ilarity score between 0 and 1. We used the cross-encoder architecture described by Reimers and Gurevych (2019), which is trained with the binary cross-entropy loss:

BCE = (y log (ˆy) + (1 − y) log (1 − ˆy))
