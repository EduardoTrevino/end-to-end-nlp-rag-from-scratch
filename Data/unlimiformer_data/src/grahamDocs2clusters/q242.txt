Question: What are the protected attributes that CMU does not use in deciding the admission of PhD students?

Context: 6.1 Setup Dataset. We use four datasets with provided sensitive attributes and two with synthesized sensitive attributes. (i) IIT-JEE: The dataset comprises the scores of candidates who took the Indian Institutes of Technology Joint Entrance Exam (IIT-JEE) in 2009. This information was made public in June 2009, following a Right to Information request [26]. It contains the scores of about 385ùëò students, the student‚Äôs gender (98ùëò women and 287ùëò men), their birth category (see [3]), and zip code.
protected attributes (e.g., race, gender), (4) all models trained on affect recognition datasets use only pre-extracted non-invertible features that rely on general visual or audio features such as the presence of a smile or magnitude of voice which cannot be used to identify the speaker [90, 92], and (5) we studied the videos collected in these affective computing datasets and found no offensive words used or personal attacks recorded in the video. Finally, we only use these datasets for
Sensitive attribute for LTR datasets. We extend prior work [11, 49, 53] and utilize a data-driven approach for selecting features as sensitive attributes and dividing items into two groups based on some threshold on that feature. Our criterion for selecting a feature as a sensitive attribute is as follows: For each feature we divide the items in two groups based on a threshold equal to the mean minus one standard deviation of that feature. If more than 95% of queries have at least one item from

Students may request to transfer into the MLT program after completing their first semester. The student must make the request in writing (or email) to the MLT/PhD Admissions Chair. The

MLT/PhD Admissions Chair will inform the student about what application materials are

required;  for example, an explanation of why a transfer is desired, a proposed plan of study, a
