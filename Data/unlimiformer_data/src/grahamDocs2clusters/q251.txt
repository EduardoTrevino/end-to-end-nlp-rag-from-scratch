We propose Inference-time Policy Adapters (IPA), which efficiently tailors a language model such as GPT-3 without fine-tuning it. IPA guides a large base model during decod- ing time through a lightweight policy adapter trained to optimize an arbitrary user objective with reinforcement learning.

Drawing inspiration from RL and inference- time techniques, we propose Inference-time Pol- icy Adapters ( IPA), an efficient and general- izable algorithm, which tailors a large language model at decoding-time toward desired objectives without fine-tuning it. To do so, IPA combines a large base LM’s output distribution with that of a smaller-sized model (a lightweight adapter pol- icy), and optimizes the combined distribution to- wards a given objective with RL (Figure 1). IPA uses two key

6.3 Conference Travel Funding

Students funded by a research project receive travel funding according to policies set by the

individual projects. Students who have no project funding may be provided with partial funding,

with a larger amount available for travel to presen t a refereed conference paper. There is an LTI

form that must be filled out in advance.

The following steps are recommended to ensure a successful internship outcome. Many of the

events below have been modified due to COVID.

September/October

Meet with your advisor to discuss your in terests and plan your internship search. 19

Review the internships of previous students. We also encourage you to speak informally

with second-year students who can offer firs t-hand information about their internships.
