HomeRobot: We also propose HomeRobot,1 a software framework to facilitate extensive bench- marking in both simulated and physical environments. It comprises identical APIs that are imple- mented across both settings, enabling researchers to conduct experiments that can be replicated in both simulated and real-world environments. Table 1 compares HomeRobot OVMM to the literature. Notably, HomeRobot provides a robotics stack for the Hello Robot Stretch which supports a range of capabilities in
