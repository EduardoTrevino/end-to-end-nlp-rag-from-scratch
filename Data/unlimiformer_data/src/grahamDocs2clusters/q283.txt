Abstract

three events (Q602744, Q8641370, Q216184) themselves constitute a hierarchical event structure.
3 Hierarchical Event Grounding The task of grounding involves linking event references in text documents to the corresponding entries in a knowl- edge base (Chandu, Bisk, and Black 2021). Pratapa, Gupta, and Mitamura (2022) studied linking event references from Wikipedia and Wikinews articles to Wikidata items. How- ever, they restrict the dictionary of Wikidata items to leaf events. This ignores important parent events such as ‘Op- eration Overlord’ and ‘Western Front (World War II)’ from
4 Dataset To the best of our knowledge, there are no existing datasets for the task of hierarchical event linking. Therefore, we ex- pand the XLEL-WD dataset (Pratapa, Gupta, and Mitamura 2022) to include hierarchical event structures.
