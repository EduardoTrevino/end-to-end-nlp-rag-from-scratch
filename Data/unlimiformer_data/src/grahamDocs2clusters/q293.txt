Question: What is StyleRF's solution to the three-way dilemma in 3D style transfer?

Context: 3D style transfer aims to render stylized novel views of a 3D scene with multi-view consistency. However, most ex- isting work suffers from a three-way dilemma over accu- rate geometry reconstruction, high-quality stylization, and being generalizable to arbitrary new styles. We propose StyleRF (Style Radiance Fields), an innovative 3D style transfer technique that resolves the three-way dilemma by performing style transformation within the feature space of a radiance ﬁeld. StyleRF employs an
In this paper, we present StyleRF, a novel zero-shot 3D style transfer method that balances the three-way dilemma over accurate geometry reconstruction, high-quality styliza- tion, and being generalizable to arbitrary new styles. By representing the 3D scene with an explicit grid of high- level features, we can faithfully restore high-ﬁdelity ge- ometry through volume rendering. Then we perform style transfer on the feature space of the scene, leading to high- quality zero-shot stylization
However, the current 3D style transfer is facing a three- way dilemma over accurate geometry reconstruction, high- quality stylization, and being generalizable to new styles. Different approaches have been investigated to resolve the three-way dilemma. For example, multiple style trans- fer [11, 22] requires a set of pre-deﬁned styles but can- not generalize to unseen new styles. Point-cloud-based style transfer [19, 37] requires a pre-trained depth estima- tion module that is prone to
