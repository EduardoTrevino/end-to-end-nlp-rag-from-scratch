help much, in which case it may be better to use a constant budget. It may also be not fast enough during the last iter- ations: suppose 95% of the problems are solved, but the re- maining 5% ones require to double the budget k more times: then the 95% will be resolved k more times (possibly finding different solutions), and, if the found solutions change, opti- mization is also performed k times before any new problem can be solved. By contrast, Orseau and Lelis [2021] use a fixed budget and
i(0) : i ∈ N). If α is pre-meet-covering/metric, then let A = (ai : i ∈ N) be a meet-covering/metric sequence with a0 = 0 and α(ai) ≤ ai−1 It is easily shown by induction that ai ≤ mi for all i ∈ N, thus M(α+) is for all i ≥ 1. pre-meet-covering/metric by Lemma 4.2.7. Conversely, if α is a graph and M(α+) is meet- covering/metric/complete, then m0 = 0, and α(mi) = α(α+(mi−1)) ≤ mi−1 for all i ≥ 1, and hence α is pre-meet-covering/metric/complete.

Proof of Proposition 4.2.6.
