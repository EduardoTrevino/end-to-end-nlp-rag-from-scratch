Question: What percentage of XLS-R’s performance can a vanilla HuBERT Base model maintain with only $3 \%$ of the data, 4 GPUs, and limited trials?

Context: 4 achieves 97.5% and 83.3% on the two cate- gories respectively. Nevertheless, there has been a gradual decline in the performance of subsequent models on other categories, such as other person (from 93.8% by davinci-002 to 68.8% by GPT- 4), in→on (from 71.4% by davinci-002 to 0% by GPT-4), and transparent access (from 66.7% by davinci-002 to 0% by GPT-4).
SELF-REFINE consistently improves over base models across all model sizes, and additionally outperforms the previous state-of-the-art across all tasks. For example, GPT-4+SELF-REFINE improves over the base GPT-4 by 8.7% (absolute) in Code Optimization, increasing optimization percentage from 27.3% to 36.0%. Confidence intervals are provided in Appendix J. For code-based tasks, we found similar trends when using CODEX; those results are included in Appendix F.
Results: We summarize our evaluation of the model selection in Table 5, and find that the top 3 chosen models all achieve 95% − 100% of the best-performing model accuracy, and above 98.5% for all datasets except MUSTARD. For example, UR-FUNNY and MUSTARD have the highest synergy (S = 0.13, S = 0.3) and indeed transformers and higher-order interactions are helpful (MULT: 0.65%, MI: 0.61%, TENSOR: 0.6%). ENRICO has the highest R = 0.73 and U2 = 0.53, and indeed methods for redundant and unique
expected to accept it in place of the LTI’s graduate fellowship. As an extra incentive to do so, the LTI will supplement the award so that the student will receive full tuition and a combined stipend 10 percent higher than that of the standard LTI graduate fellowship.

Studen ts are required to inform the LTI about any external funding that they receive.

graded on the 4.3 grading standard http://www.cmu.edu/policies/documents/Grades.html. MCDS students must maintain a 3.0 overall average each semester to remain in good standing. A student must obtain a B- or better grade in all courses, which count towards core requirements. If a student 19receives a C- or better, that course may count as an elective towards the degree requirements. All courses must receive a letter grade; courses taken pass/fail do not count towards the MCDS degree.
the 3 teams qualifying for Finals, broke the post-war record. In the finals, it was another close battle, with DTD squeaking it out over PiKA. DTD’s winning time of 2:42.5 was fast enough to set the course record, and PiKA’s 2:43.5 was only ½ second behind the prior record. SAE’s Best Design.
