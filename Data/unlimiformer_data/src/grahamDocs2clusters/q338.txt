Question: What two LTI professors were on the "Making Scalable Meta Learning Practical" paper?

Context: Paper title: 'Making Scalable Meta Learning Practical' Published year: 2023 Publication venue or conference: arXiv.org Authors: Eric P. Xing, Emma Strubell, Sang Keun Choe, Hwijeen Ahn, Pengtao Xie, W. Neiswanger, Sanket Vaibhav Mehta Summary: SAMA is designed to flexibly support a broad range of adaptive optimizers in the base level of meta learning programs, while reducing computational burden by avoiding explicit computation of second-order gradient information, and exploiting efficient

A Philosophies behind SAMA & Scalable Meta Learning

Here, we additionally discuss several important design principles and philosophies behind scalable meta learning and SAMA in a Q&A format.
dialogue systems, information retrieval, machine translation, speech processing,  video

understanding, multimodal systems, automated reasoning, and other topics related to analysis

and understanding of unstructured information  (e.g., machine learning, and software engineering

of intelligent systems).

1.2 Department Personnel

The people responsible for administering the LTI Ph.D.  degree are:

Jamie Callan

Ph.D. Program Director

Professor

GHC 5419

callan@cs.cmu.edu
offered by the Language Technologies Institute (LTI), a graduate department in the School of

Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University. The MIIS degree provides advanced study

and practical experience in areas of Computer Science focused on the processing and analysis

of unstructured and semi -structured information, for example, text, image, video, speech, and

audio information. It is a practice -oriented professional degree designed for students who
At least two LTI faculty members will attend the presentation, including the research advisor.

After the presentation, these faculty members will convene and provide written feedback to both the student and the Program Director  of graduate programs (the form for this is available on the

LTI website). This feedback will help the student refine speaking skills with respect to talk

structure, content,  and delivery.
