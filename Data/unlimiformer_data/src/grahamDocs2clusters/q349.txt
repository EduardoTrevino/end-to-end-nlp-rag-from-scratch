Question: In the paper "KIT’s Multilingual Speech Translation System for IWSLT 2023", what approach was used for effective adaptation in the absence of training data from the target domain?

Context: In this paper, we described our systems for the mul- tilingual speech translation track of IWSLT 2023, which translates English speech into 10 target lan- guages. To tackle the task of translating scien- tific conference talks, which feature non-native in- put speech and terminology-dense contents, our systems have several novelties. Lacking suitable training data for the target domain, we used kNN- MT for inference-time adaptation and showed an improvement of +0.8 BLEU for cascaded speech

system, we use our machine translation model for knowledge distillation. We also ensemble models trained with and without synthesized speech data.

Our main findings are as follow:
