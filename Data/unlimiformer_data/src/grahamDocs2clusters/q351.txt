benchmark only measures inference runtime, and the energy and carbon footprint are only roughly estimated. HULK (Zhou et al., 2021) evaluates energy efficiency as a proxy of time and cost, while Pentathlon evaluates multiple different efficiency metrics in a realistic way. Long-Range Arena (Tay et al., 2021) builds a set of synthesized tasks to evaluate the long-range capabilities of NLP models in terms of generalization and computational efficiency including speed and memory footprint.

15. Model checking, 1994 CMU professor Edmund Clarke had long stressed the importance of verifying computer hardware and software through a formal problem-solving technique called “model checking.” In 1994, his arguments gained new weight with the discovery that Intel’s amazing new Pentium chip made errors on certain math problems. Clarke would go on to receive the Turing Award for his role in the development of model checking.
