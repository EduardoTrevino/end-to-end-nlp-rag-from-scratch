Question: How much does it cost to apply for the MLT program if an application is submitted on November 20th, 2023?

Context: Cost of Query Generation. For the original InPars Bonifacio et al. (2022), the cost of generation for the GPT-3 Curie model is $0.002 per one thousand tokens. The token count includes the length of the prompt and the prompting document.14 We estimate that (depending on the collection) a single generation involves 300 to 500 tokens: long-document collections Robust04 and TREC-COVID both have close to 500 tokens per generation.

Taking an estimate of 500 tokens per generation, the cost of querying OpenAI GPT-3 Curie API can be up to $100 for Robust04 and TREC-COVID. Assuming that sampling from the 137-B FLAN model (used by (Dai et al., 2022)) to be as expensive as from the largest GPT-3 model Davinci (which has a similar number of parameters), each generation in the Promptagator study (Dai et al., 2022), was 10x more expensive compared to InPars study (Bonifacio et al., 2022). Moreover, because Dai et al. (2022)
