The MOORA method was first introduced by a scientist named Braurers in 2004 to solve various problems in making difficult decisions [12]. Since its introduction by Braurers, MOORA has been widely used to solve decision-making problems to provide accurate and reliable results [13]. In Muhammad Fachrizal Anshary et al.'s research, it was concluded that the MOORA method has a good
