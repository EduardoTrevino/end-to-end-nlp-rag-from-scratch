Question: What's the cost in us dollars per program for the masters degrees in language technologies if you submit before the early deadline?

Context: for Google Translate is roughly $2.66 re- gardless of the target language, since Google’s API only charges for input characters.
We estimated cost values for each MT system and language: the expense, in USD, of translat- ing the full FLORES-200 devtest English set into the language. We estimated costs of GPT models using the prompts employed in our experiments,

model NLLB ChatGPT (0-shot) ChatGPT (5-shot) Google GPT-4 (5-shot)

cost $0.09 $0.35 $1.32 $2.66 $25.93

Table 10: Estimated cost in USD to translate FLORES- 200 devtest ENG→X with each system, averaged across all languages we evaluated with each
These visualizations are also available on our repository. (Also see our Zeno browser for interac- tive visualizations of our results.) We also include cost estimates and scores divided thereby for all languages and MT systems in Table 14. We ex- clude cost estimates by language for NLLB and Google because there is very little variation be- tween languages. Our estimated cost of translat- ing FLORES-200 devtest ENG→ is approximately $0.09 for every target language. And the respective estimate
