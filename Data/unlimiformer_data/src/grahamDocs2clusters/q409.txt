Question: In summer 2024, When do Mini-5 Final Exams take place?

Context: We follow Liu et al. (2022) to choose k-NN exam- ples from the training corpus. The demonstrations are encoded by all-MiniLM-L6-v2. For LMs with maximum context length as 2048, we set k to 32; and for LMs with maximum context length as 1024, we set k to 16.

We conduct other baselines with the code imple- mented by Meng et al. (2022a). 1 We simply add the preﬁx Prompt: in prompts and report the re- sults conducted by us.

Five interviews were conducted with participants from all three institutions. This round proved to be very valuable with regard to the functionality of the website and what content we should include or exclude. We asked our
