Figure 3: Comparison of inference encoder-decoder alignment of different models. For Transformer TTS we picked one of the cross-attentions which learn alignment. See Appendix C for the cross-attentions of all heads and layers.

Table 2: Comparison of TTS models. MOS is with 95% conﬁdence interval. MCD is with one standard deviation.

3.3.6.3 Areas of Concentration In addition to the common MCDS core, all students must complete at least one area of concentration, which consists of three courses in Analytics, Systems, or Human- Centered Data Science. Students consult with their academic advisor and choose one or more areas of concentration during their first semester, in preparation for enrolling in Spring classes.
The MCDS Program offers a core curriculum and several concentrations; students entering the program enroll in core courses in their first semester and select further courses to satisfy at least one concentration (see Section 3.3.6). Students construct their own course of study, in consultation with their academic advisor, in order to satisfy broad guidelines. Thus, a student may tailor their coursework in a given concentration to follow a particular area of emphasis. The MCDS program is
information technology, software services and social media companies. Requirements: The MCDS program offers three majors: Systems, Analytics, and Human-Centered Data Science. All three require the same total number of course credits, split among required core courses, electives, data science seminar and capstone courses specifically defined for each major. The degree can also be earned in two different ways, depending on the length of time you spend working on it.
