Question: What do the KALE vocabulary semantic concepts perform better than?

Context: Results show GEN performs overall better than D&A, but without surpassing H&S, which has the best overall results. Some conﬁgurations of GEN surpass H&S in some metrics (highlighted), but all together GEN does not surpass H&S. We can also observe that semantic metrics are less prone to distinguish the systems as lexical ones.

next-word prediction. In this paper, we set out to understand why retrieval-augmented language models, and speciﬁcally why k-nearest neighbor language models (kNN-LMs) perform better than standard parametric LMs, even when the k-nearest neighbor component retrieves examples from the same training set that the LM was originally trained on. To this end, we perform a careful analysis of the various dimensions over which kNN-LM diverges from standard LMs, and investigate these dimensions one by
We observe that when using only RGB-segments (with- out depth) for object-region estimates, there exists an inter- mediate value along the range of ks ∈ {25, 50, 100} where the semantic segmentation performance peaks. This trend empirically validates our intuition for choosing the best ks as discussed in Section 3.1. In fact, too small a value can be highly undesirable as it can lead to worse results (52.1 mIoU) than even the base method (52.8 mIoU). It is how- ever, interesting to note that

Duolingo has developed language tutoring software that enables users to learn Spanish, English, Italian, German, Portuguese or French for free through its website and mobile apps. In the process, Duolingo users are helping to translate the Web.
