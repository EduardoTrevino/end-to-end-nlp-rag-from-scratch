Question: In the paper "Improving Perceptual Quality, Intelligibility, and Acoustics on VoIP Platforms", which preprocessing methods were experimented with for audio data?

Context: on pre-trained speech recogni- tion models, however, this can be limiting since this approach primarily measures speech intelligibility. In this paper, we propose an evaluation technique involving the training of an ASR model on synthetic speech and assessing its performance on real speech. Our main assumption is that by training the ASR model on the synthetic speech, the WER on real speech reflects the similarity between distributions, a broader assess- ment of synthetic speech quality beyond
This paper makes the following contributions:

1. We propose a new evaluation method for TTS that captures distributional similarity between real and synthetic speech as a proxy for perceptual speech quality tests.

2. We compare the proposed metric to multiple automatic metrics and Mean Opinion Score (MOS), and show that our metric correlates well with human-provided MOS.
