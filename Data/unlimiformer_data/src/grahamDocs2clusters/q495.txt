Buggy Races Keep Rolling at Carnegie Mellon

In its 99th year, the tradition is a Spring Carnival treat

By Heidi Opdyke

Sweepstakes, also known as the Buggy Races, has come a long way at Carnegie Mellon University. The slick, torpedo-like vessels carrying drivers with nerves of steel are a far cry from the two-man teams that once changed places halfway through a race and rode in everything from rain barrels with bicycle wheels to three-wheeled ash cans 99 years ago.
Delta Upsilon entered a three-wheeled buggy in 1940.

It’s quirky, it’s different, and it’s so Carnegie Mellon University, where the college experience is a little buggy.

Sweepstakes, better known as the Spring Carnival Buggy Races, will celebrate its 100th anniversary April 17-18, 2020. The CMU tradition is unlike any other.
1946 Raceday: Prelims on Friday, May 3 at 4:30pm; Finals on Saturday, May 11* at 2:00pm

Sweepstakes Committee: John H. Siepel (Chair)

Race Results: (1) DTD (3:49? ); (2) KapSig; (DQ) PiKA

Design Comp: (1) Beta
