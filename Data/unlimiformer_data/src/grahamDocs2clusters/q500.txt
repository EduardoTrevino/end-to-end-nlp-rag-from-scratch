Question: What is the full name of the conference where the paper The Devil Is in the Errors: Leveraging Large Language Models for Fine-grained Machine Translation Evaluation, got published?

Context: Paper title: 'INSTRUCTSCORE: Towards Explainable Text Generation Evaluation with Automatic Feedback' Published year: 2023 Publication venue or conference: Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing Authors: Lei Li, William Yang Wang, Markus Freitag, Danqing Wang, Wenda Xu, Zhenqiao Song, Liangming Pan Summary: This work fine-tunes a LLAMA model to create an evaluative metric that can produce a diagnostic report aligned with human judgment, and achieves performance levels on
Thompson B. and Post M. (2020). Automatic machine translation evaluation in many languages via zero-shot paraphrasing.

In Proceedings of the 2020 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pp. 90â€“121.

equivalent (an oral presentation that at least t wo SCS faculty certify as being of

conference- talk quality).

Programming:  This is satisfied by demonstrating competence in computer programming

of language technology; this is normally satisfied in the course of the student's research

and/or project work.
