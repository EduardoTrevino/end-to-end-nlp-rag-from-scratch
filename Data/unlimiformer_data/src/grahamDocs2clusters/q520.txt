Question: How many authors contributed to the work Understanding Political Polarisation using Language Models: A dataset and method?

Context: [38] Irene Solaiman and Christy Dennison. Process for adapting language models to society (palms) with values-targeted datasets. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 34:5861– 5873, 2021.
Paper title: 'Generating Images with Multimodal Language Models' Published year: 2023 Publication venue or conference: arXiv.org Authors: Daniel Fried, R. Salakhutdinov, Jing Yu Koh Summary: This work proposes a method to fuse frozen text-only large language models (LLMs) with pre-trained image encoder and decoder models, by mapping between their embedding spaces, and exhibits a wider range of capabilities compared to prior multimodal language models.
Paper title: 'Understanding the Effect of Model Compression on Social Bias in Large Language Models' Published year: 2023 Publication venue or conference: Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing Authors: Emma Strubell, Gustavo Gonçalves Summary: A carefully controlled study of the impact of model compression via quantization and knowledge distillation on measures of social bias in LLMs finds that longer pretraining and larger models led to higher social bias, and
