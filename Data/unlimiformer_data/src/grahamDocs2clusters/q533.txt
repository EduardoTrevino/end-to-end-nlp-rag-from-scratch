Question: Is the GRE optional for the masters in language technologies application? Answer yes or no.

Context: has been shown to improve sequence modeling for tasks which naturally decompose into sub-tasks. Fi- nally, large language model decoders (e.g. mBART (Liu et al., 2020b)) can be adopted through an inte- gration with HuggingFace (Wolf et al., 2020).
Existing pretraining frameworks for language models fall into three categories: autoregressive, autoencod- ing, and encoder–decoder models. Most recent large language models, such as the GPT series [RWC+19, BMR+20, Ope23], LLaMA [TLI+23, TMS+23], BLOOM [SFA+23], and Falcon [AAA+23], are autore- gressive, using a left-to-right language model objective. Earlier models such as BERT [DCLT19], ELEC- TRA [CLLM20], and RoBERTa [LOG+19] are encoder-only, while BART [LLG+19] and T5 [RSR+20] are
including applications that adapt their design and functionality to the needs of different cultures (e.g., Oyibo, 2016; Reinecke and Bernstein, 2011, 2013). Similarly, language models could be made in more culturally adaptive ways, because one size does not fit all (Groenwold et al., 2020; Rettberg, 2022). Therefore, we urge the NLP community to value the adaptation of language technologies from one language or culture to another (Joshi et al., 2020).

Requirements The School of Computer Science requires the following for all graduate program applications: GRE scores: GREs are now optional, but if you want to submit GRE scores: These must be less than five years old. A GRE subject test in science, engineering, computer science, math, etc. is not required, but you may complete one and submit the scores if you wish.
