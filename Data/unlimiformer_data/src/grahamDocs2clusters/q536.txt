Question: In "Deriving Vocal Fold Oscillation Information from Recorded Voice Signals Using Models of Phonation", what is the proposed forward-backward algorithm?

Context: Paper title: 'Deriving Vocal Fold Oscillation Information from Recorded Voice Signals Using Models of Phonation' Published year: 2023 Publication venue or conference: Entropy Authors: Wayne Zhao, Rita Singh Summary: A novel analysis-by-synthesis approach that allows us to infer the VFOs directly from recorded speech signals on an individualized, speaker- by-speaker basis is proposed and it is shown how the V FOs can be quantified from a dynamical systems perspective for classification purposes.
least over these specific neural populations. There also appears to be a causal role

for α oscillations in perceptual binding (Zhang et al., 2019).

At the same time, in the realm of speech it has been suggested that ‘forward

entrainment’ (neural entrainment that outlasts the entraining stimulus) “may instantiate

46

a dynamic auditory afterimage that lasts a fraction of a second to minimize prediction

error in signal processing” (Saberi and Hickok, 2022). Speech envelope tracking via θ
may “leverage forward entrainment as a generative model of speech-segment timing

to more efficiently process upcoming segments (where timing is inferred from

expectations and priors in a Bayesian sense)” (Ibid.). This particular topic remains a

contested space.

Regardless, as noted by Earl K. Miller, questions about the causal role of oscillations

could also be asked of spikes. Both are signals that work together, and decoupling
