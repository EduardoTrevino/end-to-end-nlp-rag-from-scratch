Question: According to the paper PROMPT2MODEL: Generating Deployable Models from Natural Language Instructions, what is the exact match achieved by gpt-3.5-turbo on the Squad dataset?

Context: the alignment-based matching to relevant labels may not be sufﬁciently effective. A natural rem- edy is to elaborate the input with a pre-trained GPT model to generate multiple pieces of texts. Speciﬁcally, we use a simple human instruction, "Elaborate the text with a few sentences," to guide the instruction-tuned GPT model, such as Alpaca- 7B (Taori et al., 2023), in generating probable ex- pansions and continuations of the text. Our sys- tem treats the concatenation of the input text and each
2 GPT-3 is one of most famous autoregressive English language models released. It was released by OpenAI in June 2020, after 355 compute years of training (on a V100). It consists of 175 billion param- eters and is particularly good at generating coherent and creative text. 3 Note how this is orthogonal to Gold (1967), arguing that grammar cannot be acquired from raw text: Even if language was subregular and learnable in the limit, meaning would not necessarily be learnable. Similarly, Gold
