Question: How does using random walks to estimate entity centrality on conversation entity graphs affect answer passage ranking?

Context: Paper title: 'Conversational Search with Random Walks over Entity Graphs' Published year: 2023 Publication venue or conference: International Conference on the Theory of Information Retrieval Authors: Gustavo Gonçalves, Jamie Callan, João Magalhães Summary: Experiments show that using random walks to estimate entity centrality on conversation entity graphs improves top precision answer passage ranking over competitive transformer-based baselines.
pseudo query. Then, in each sampled passage, we randomly pick an anchor entity and take the first passage of its associated Wikipedia page as the tar- get. To avoid redundancy, if an anchor entity has been used 10 times in a source page, we no longer pick it for the given source. If the query and the target together exceed 512 tokens, we will truncate the longer of the two by randomly dropping its first token or its last token.
