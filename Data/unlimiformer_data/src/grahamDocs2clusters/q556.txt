Question: What is Martial Herbert's one word title, this is not the one with the word professor in it?

Context: 4 In Philosophical Investigations (6), Wittgenstein writes, for example, that ‘[ostensive teaching of words] is an important part of the training, because it is so with human beings; not because it could not be imagined otherwise.’

experiment with a neural language model. The Octopus thought experiment was awarded a best paper prize and was widely debated in the AI community. Again, however, even its fiercest opponents accepted the premise that what a word refers to cannot be induced in the absence of direct supervision. I will argue that what a word refers to is probably learnable from raw text alone. Here’s why: higher-order concept co-occurrence statistics are stable across languages and across modalities, because
We hypothesize that this is because by just adding more embeddings, while still using the same training procedure as the original LM, the multiple embeddings for each word type after learning could still be very close to each other, and thus do not increase the softmax capacity much. This suggests that some regularization terms may be needed during training to make the multiple embeddings not converge to the same vector, rendering over-parameterization useless.
