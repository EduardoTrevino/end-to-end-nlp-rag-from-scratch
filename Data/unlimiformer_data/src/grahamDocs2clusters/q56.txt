Question: By whom was Kevlar fiber invented?

Context: The Harary-Ross algorithm has ﬂaws, as reported by Harary in his 1969 text, “Graph Theory” [23]. Instead of using that algorithm, I used a more modern one, the Tomita variant of the Bron-Kerbosch algorithm. In 1967, Edward Bierstone and Allen Bernholtz developed a semilattice recomposition program described in their report “HIDECS-RECOMP PROCEDURE” [19]. I coded it up to visualize the produced decompositions. Rather than trying to describe the algorithm, I’ll quote Bierstone and Bernholtz:

4. Speech recognition, 1976 If you have an iPhone, ask Siri to look up “Hearsay I,” the first computer system capable of continuous speech recognition. It was developed by future Turing Award winner and future SCS dean Raj Reddy along with his students. Their work on subsequent systems established many of the principles that still underlie speech recognition software.
