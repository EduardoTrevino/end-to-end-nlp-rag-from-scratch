Title: Search Engines
Information retrieval, machine translation and speech technology are used daily by the general public, while text mining, natural language processing and language-based tutoring are common within more specialized professional or educational environments. The LTI prepares students for this world by offering a minor that gives you the opportunity to not only learn about language technologies, but to also apply that knowledge through a directed project.
Fall 2: - Machine Learning for Text Mining - MIIS Capstone Project

Example Course of Study #2 This schedule would satisfy course requirements for a student interested in voice-based computer applications.

Fall 1:

Machine Learning

Algorithms for NLP

Speech Recognition and Understanding

Directed Study

Spring: - Applied Machine Learning - Competitive Engineering - Design and Implementation of Speech Recognition Systems - Directed Study - MIIS Capstone Planning Seminar

Summer:

Internship
by actual classroom courses, not credit given for research or independent study.

An “LTI course ” is any 12 -unit course with a number of 11 -XXX; a  6-unit course with 11 -XXX

counts as one- half of an LTI course. Unless otherwise specified, "course" means an actual

classroom course, not  credit given for research or independent study. Note that the LTI  allow s

any one MLD (10 -XXX) graduate course to count as an "LTI course".
