Question: What are the multimodal capabilities of the proposed model in "Generating Images with Multimodal Language Models"?

Context: Paper title: 'Generating Images with Multimodal Language Models' Published year: 2023 Publication venue or conference: arXiv.org Authors: Daniel Fried, R. Salakhutdinov, Jing Yu Koh Summary: This work proposes a method to fuse frozen text-only large language models (LLMs) with pre-trained image encoder and decoder models, by mapping between their embedding spaces, and exhibits a wider range of capabilities compared to prior multimodal language models.
In this work, we tackle the task of extending multimodal language models to generate novel images. Our approach, Generating Images with Large Language Models (GILL), is capable of processing arbitrarily interleaved image-and-text inputs to generate text, retrieve images, and generate novel images (Fig. 1). Our findings show that it is possible to efficiently map the output embedding space of a frozen text-only LLM to that of a frozen generation model (in this work, Stable Diffusion [49])
We propose a method to fuse frozen text-only large language models (LLMs) with pre-trained image encoder and decoder models, by mapping between their embedding spaces. Our model demonstrates a wide suite of multimodal capabilities: image retrieval, novel image generation, and multimodal dialogue. Ours is the first approach capable of conditioning on arbitrarily interleaved image and text inputs to generate coherent image (and text) outputs. To achieve strong performance on image generation, we
