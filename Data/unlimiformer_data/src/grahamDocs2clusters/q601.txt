Several existing benchmarks also include multilingual SSL models [13–15]. Lebenchmark primarily evaluates speech tasks in French [13]; IndicSUPERB focuses mostly on Indian lan- guages [14]. XTREME-S focuses on multilingual speech rep- resentation benchmarks, including ASR, speech translation, speech classification, and speech retrieval [15]. There are three main differences between XTREME-S and ML-SUPERB. Firstly, ML-SUPERB covers a wider range of languages, with 143 languages compared to
