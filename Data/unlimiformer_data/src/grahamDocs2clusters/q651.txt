ABSTRACT Recent research has shown that training low-rank neural networks can effectively reduce the total number of trainable parameters without sacriﬁcing predictive accuracy, resulting in end-to-end speedups. However, low-rank model training necessitates adjusting several additional factorization hyperparameters, such as the rank of the factorization at each layer. In this paper, we tackle this challenge by introducing CUTTLEFISH, an automated low-rank training approach that eliminates the
