Question: What is the proposed approach in the paper "Rethinking Voice-Face Correlation: A Geometry View"?

Context: To investigate and understand the voice-face correlation at a more fine-grained phoneme level, we propose an anal- ysis pipeline that leverages a common feature extractor with a regression head to predict human anthropometric measure- ments (AM) from phoneme. Specifically, Human anthropomet- ric measurements are a set of facial measurements summarized from cognitive science studies that can effectively represent the identity of a human. We decompose the audio recordings into phonemes and learn
and movements in the face. Therefore, it is advanta- geous to discover the hidden link between phonemes and face attributes. In this paper, we propose an analysis pipeline to help us explore the voice-face relationship in a fine-grained manner, i.e., phonemes vs. facial anthropometric measurements (AM). We build an estimator for each phoneme-AM pair and evaluate the correlation through hypothesis testing. Our results indicate that AMs are more predictable from vowels compared to conso- nants,
Rethinking the human voice production mechanism, the voice is produced by either the vibration of the vocal cord or the resonance of the pulmonary airflow. For both of the mecha- nisms, the vocal track is highly enrolled. The vocal track can be assumed as a filter, reflecting the characteristics of human voice. With the tight bind of muscle and bone, the vocal track is also correlated with facial attributes. Specifically, each phoneme corresponds to a different vocal track status and also an
