Question: Which shared task does "Language-Agnostic Transformers and Assessing ChatGPT-Based Query Rewriting for Multilingual Document-Grounded QA" focus on?

Context: Paper title: 'Language-Agnostic Transformers and Assessing ChatGPT-Based Query Rewriting for Multilingual Document-Grounded QA' Published year: 2023 Publication venue or conference: Workshop on Document-grounded Dialogue and Conversational Question Answering Authors: T. Mitamura, Srijan Bansal, Mitali Potnis, Soham Dinesh Tiwari, Srinivas Gowriraj, Eric Nyberg Summary: This paper assesses the effectiveness of both language-agnostic and language-aware paradigms for multilingual pre-trained
With the above challenges in mind, in this paper, we propose FACTOOL, a task and do- main agnostic framework for detecting factual errors of texts generated by large language models (e.g., ChatGPT). Experiments on four different tasks (knowledge-based QA, code generation, mathematical reasoning, and sci- entific literature review) show the efficacy of the proposed method. We release the code of FACTOOL associated with ChatGPT plu- gin interface at https://github.com/ GAIR-NLP/factool.
