Question: What does CLIP stand for?

Context: Table 1: Retrieval accuracy on ImageCoDe test split with human-written contextual captions as input. In the proposed method, we use CLIP-zero-shot as the base listener and ALBEF-finetuned as the listener for evaluation. CLIP-finetuned denotes the best-performing model in previous work. The fine-tuned ALBEF outper- forms the best CLIP model with a large margin on static images while improving slightly on video frames. Com- paring with performances on static images, all models struggle on video
ities, making them exceptionally valuable for a wide range of AI applications [16]–[18]. One such model, Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) [16], is trained from scratch on an extensive dataset comprising 400 million (im- age, text) pairs. CLIP’s representations can seamlessly trans- fer to many downstream tasks without fine-tuning. While prior research has primarily focused on integrating audio modalities into CLIP’s embedding space [19], including a robot’s haptic data into this
Representations with CLIP. Recent advances have revealed the potential of contrastive objectives to yield generalized representations for both text and images [16], [17]. Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) [16] has delivered state-of-the-art representations that excel in diverse tasks, including zero-shot image classification, image retrieval via text, and guiding generative models [25]. While CLIP’s knowledge has been distilled for audio [19], our MOSAIC approach is the first to
