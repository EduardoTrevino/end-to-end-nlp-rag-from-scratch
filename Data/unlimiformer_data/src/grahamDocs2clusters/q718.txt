Abstract
In this work, we delve deeply into a fundamental question: whether there exists any “enigmatic” link between phoneme and facial features. If so, whether those “enigmatic” links can be quantitatively described? As a forerunner in this field, we de- sign a phoneme-AMs paradigm, which enables us to explore the speech-face relationship in a fine-grained manner. Hypothesis testing is utilized to verify whether an AM is predictable from a phoneme. Experiments show that AMs are averagely more

CAPTCHAs, 2000 “Spam” and malicious attacks were a growing problem on the Internet when hackers developed automated “bots” that could sign up for email and other Web services without human intervention. Luis von Ahn (CS’03,’05), Nick Hopper (CS’04), John Langford (CS’02) and CMU professor Manuel Blum invented a “Completely Automated Public Turing Test to tell Computers and Humans Apart,” or CAPTCHA, to help foil the bots. A later variation, reCAPTCHA, is helping digitize old books and
