Question: How many authors contributed to the paper CodeBERTScore: Evaluating Code Generation with Pretrained Models of Code?

Context: Paper title: 'CodeBERTScore: Evaluating Code Generation with Pretrained Models of Code' Published year: 2023 Publication venue or conference: Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing Authors: Sumit Agarwal, Graham Neubig, Uri Alon, Shuyan Zhou Summary: It is found that generated code that receives a higher score by CodeBERTScore is more likely to be preferred by humans, as well as to function correctly when executed, than all existing metrics.

professional education. Drawing on Shaw’s plan and also on the work of other faculty members, an undergraduate program in computer science was created during the 1989-90 academic year. Seven CS majors were admitted to the program as sophomores. Another 73 undergraduates were admitted in 1990–91. By 1995, there were 401 undergraduates in the School of Computer Science; in fall 2013, more than 600 undergraduates made up about 37 percent of student enrollment at SCS, along with more than 600
