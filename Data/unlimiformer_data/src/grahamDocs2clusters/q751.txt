Context: Paper title: 'Quantifying & Modeling Feature Interactions: An Information Decomposition Framework' Published year: 2023 Publication venue or conference: arXiv.org Authors: Louis-Philippe Morency, P. Liang, Chun Kai Ling, Zihao Deng, Faisal Mahmood, R. Salakhutdinov, Suzanne Nie, Richard J. Chen, Yun Cheng, Xiang Fan Summary: This work proposes an information-theoretic approach to quantify the degree of redundancy, uniqueness, and synergy across input features, which is term the PID statistics
5 Conclusion

Our work aims to quantify the nature and degree of feature interactions by proposing scalable estimators for redundancy, uniqueness, and synergy suitable for high-dimensional heterogeneous datasets. Through comprehensive experiments and real-world applications, we demonstrate the utility of our proposed framework in dataset quantification, model quantification, and model selection. We are aware of some potential limitations:
Figure 6: The PID framework formalizes the nature of feature interactions for a task. Through our proposed scalable estimators for redundancy, uniqueness, and synergy, we demonstrate their useful- ness towards quantifying multimodal datasets and multimodal model predictions, which together yield principles for model selection.
