Question: In the paper "Accelerating Diffusion-based Combinatorial Optimization Solvers by Progressive Distillation", what is the performance degradation of the progressively distilled model on the TSP-50 dataset?

Context: Paper title: 'DIFUSCO: Graph-based Diffusion Solvers for Combinatorial Optimization' Published year: 2023 Publication venue or conference: arXiv.org Authors: Zhiqing Sun, Yiming Yang Summary: DIFUSCO is introduced, a new graph-based diffusion framework for NPC combinatorial optimization that outperforms the previous state-of-the-art neural solvers on the challenging SATLIB benchmark and investigates two types of diffusion models with Gaussian and Bernoulli noise, respectively.
Motivated by the recent remarkable success of diffusion models in probabilistic generation [102, 40, 94, 120, 96], we introduce a novel approach named DIFUSCO, which stands for the graph-based DIFfUsion Solvers for Combinatorial Optimization. To apply the iterative denoising process of diffusion models to graph-based settings, we formulate each NPC problem as to find a {0, 1}-valued vector that indicates the optimal selection of nodes or edges in a candidate solution for the task. Then we use a
Neural network-based Combinatorial Optimization (CO) methods have shown promising results in solving various NP-complete (NPC) problems without relying on hand-crafted domain knowledge. This paper broadens the current scope of neural solvers for NPC problems by introducing a new graph-based diffusion framework, namely DIFUSCO. Our framework casts NPC problems as discrete {0, 1}-vector optimization problems and leverages graph-based denoising diffusion models to generate high-quality solutions.
