Question: What is the novel architecture introduced in the paper "Efficient Sequence Transduction by Jointly Predicting Tokens and Durations"?

Context: maintain dimensions that are congruent with GPT- 3 models. Additionally, all of our models are trained to handle a maximum sequence length of 2,048 tokens. The detailed architecture is shown in Table 4. Alibi [28]. Alibi introduces a more streamlined and efficient positional ap- proach called Attention with Linear Biases. Rather than adding positional em- beddings to word embeddings, ALiBi applies a bias to query-key attention scores, penalizing them based on their distance. SwiGLU [32]. SwiGLU
Paper title: 'Exploration of Efficient End-to-End ASR using Discretized Input from Self-Supervised Learning' Published year: 2023 Publication venue or conference: Interspeech Authors: Xuankai Chang, Yuya Fujita, Takashi Maekaku, Shinji Watanabe, Brian Yan Summary: This paper proposes a new protocol that utilizes discretized token sequences in ASR tasks, which includes de-duplication and sub-word modeling to enhance the input sequence and reduces computational cost by decreasing the length of
to-sequence (Seq2Seq) models. So far, we only reduce the size of data in terms of storage. However, it doesn’t affect the com- putation efficiency, which is dominated by the model size and sequence length. To address the latter factor, we propose two methods. First, we can combine consecutively repeated tokens into a single one [29]. Second, we apply subword modeling on discrete tokens [30] to divide the sequence into subsequences, each of which is represented as a single meta-token. We evalu-
