Question: What dataset does the BASS paper by Bhiksha Raj's group evaluate on?

Context: Paper title: 'Token Prediction as Implicit Classification to Identify LLM-Generated Text' Published year: 2023 Publication venue or conference: Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing Authors: Yutian Chen, Hao Kang, Liangze Li, Vivian Zhai, Rita Singh, Bhiksha Raj Summary: Evaluation shows the exceptional performance of the method in the text classification task, highlighting its simplicity and efficiency, and interpretability studies on the features extracted by the
Paper title: 'Evaluating Speech Synthesis by Training Recognizers on Synthetic Speech' Published year: 2023 Publication venue or conference: arXiv.org Authors: Roshan Sharma, Hira Dhamyal, Dareen Alharthi, Rita Singh, Bhiksha Raj, Soumi Maiti Summary: This paper proposes an evaluation technique involving the training of an ASR model on synthetic speech and assessing its performance on real speech, and demonstrates a strong correlation with both MOS naturalness and MOS intelligibility when
We consider six popular datasets for evaluation, all focused on Wikipedia, with four single-hop data, NQ (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019), WebQ (Be- rant et al., 2013), SQuAD (Rajpurkar et al., 2016) and EntityQuestions (Sciavolino et al., 2021); two multi-hop data, HotpotQA (Yang et al., 2018) and OTT-QA (Chen et al., 2021a). Dataset-specific corpora are used for multi-hop datasets, because HotpotQA requires retrieval hopping between text passages while table-passage hopping is demanded by OTT-QA.

learning model is developed for and evaluated on real world datasets.
semester, the faculty evaluates each student's academic progress. The student's advisor serves

as the student's advocate in this process. The result of the evaluation is a letter from the faculty to the student that indicates whether the student is making satisfactory progress towards

completing the degree.

A good letter  typically indicates that the student is making satisfactory progress. If the student
