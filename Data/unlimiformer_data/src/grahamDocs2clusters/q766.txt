Question: What are the three aspects assessed by the holistic evaluation in MultiZoo & MultiBench?

Context: In this section, we outline the design principles and process of evaluating multi-modal LLMs (i.e., AudioGPT). SpeciÔ¨Åcally, we evaluate the LLMs in the following three aspects: 1) Consistency, which measures whether the LLMs properly understand the intention of a user, and assigns the audio foundation models closely aligned with human cognition and problem-solving; 2) Capabilitity, which measures the performance of audio foundation models in handling complex audio tasks, understanding and
We present Pentathlon, a benchmark for holistic and realistic evaluation of inference efficiency. Pentathlon targets multiple aspects of efficiency including latency, throughput, memory overhead, number of parameters, and energy consumption, on a strictly-controlled hardware platform. Inte- grating evaluation with Pentathlon is seamless and can drastically reduce the workload to make fair and reproducible efficiency comparisons. Pentathlon offers both testing in real-world application scenarios

end of the semester, the faculty evaluates each student's academic progress. The student's advisor serves as the student's advocate in this process. The result of the evaluation is a letter from the faculty to the student that indicates whether the student is making satisfactory progress  towards completing the degre e.

A good letter  typically indicates that the student is making satisfactory progress. If the student
