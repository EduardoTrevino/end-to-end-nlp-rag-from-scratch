Question: What does the Plan module in the PET framework do?

Context: We propose the Plan, Eliminate, and Track (PET) framework. The Plan module trans- lates a task description into a list of high-level sub-tasks. The Eliminate module masks out irrelevant objects and receptacles from the ob- servation for the current sub-task. Finally, the Track module determines whether the agent has accomplished each sub-task. On the Alf- World instruction following benchmark, the PET framework leads to a signiﬁcant 15% improvement over SOTA for generalization to human goal
Figure 1. PET framework. Plan module uses LLM to gen- erate a high-level plan. Eliminate Module uses a QA model to mask irrelevant objects in observation. Track module uses a QA model to track the completion of sub-tasks.
In this work, we explore alternative mechanisms to leverage the prior knowledge encoded in LLMs without impacting the trainable nature of the actor. We propose a 3-step framework (Figure 1): Plan, Eliminate, and Track (PET). Plan module simpliﬁes complex tasks by breaking them down into sub-tasks. It uses a pre- trained LLM to generate a list of sub-tasks for an input task description employing example prompts from the training set similar to Huang et al. (2022a); Ahn et al. (2022). The

4.6 Registration Process/Procedures

Students are responsible for registering for their courses. Use the Stellic Degree Audit
a. The capstone project (36 units) is a large, group- oriented demonstration of

student skill in one or more areas covered by the degree. Typically,  the result of

the capstone project is a major software application. The capstone project is

supervised by a member of the faculty who meets with students on a weekly

basis to monitor progress and provide guidance. MIIS Graduate Student Handbook  Page 17

It is the responsibility of each student to make arrangements with Student Health Services to

either pay for their insurance at the beginning of the semester or  elect a payment plan over the MIIS Graduate Student Handbook  Page 32
