In this paper we introduced SENTECON, a human- interpretable language representation that captures sentence context while retaining the benefits of interpretable lexicons. We conducted human evalu- ations to determine the agreement between SENTE- CON representations and the actual content of the

2We use the term “sentence” for clarity, but our approach is also applicable to longer passages of text like paragraphs and documents, as our experiments show.

Computer Facilities publishes a list of printers online at https://computing.cs.cmu.edu/desktop/printing. Wh en you send a file to  the print queue, you

may go to any of the listed printers, swipe yo ur CMU ID, and the file will be printed on that

printer.

9.3 Computers for MS Students

Students are expected to provide their own laptop computers that can be used to access
thesis defense. The pre sentation must communicate the research work done, similar to

a conference paper presentation. The committee will observe the presentation, and then decide whether the thesis and presentation were acceptable, or whether further

work is required. Unlike a P hD defense, only a simple majority vote of the committee is

required for approval.
The use of a photocopier or printer requires you to log in with your CMU ID card. LTI’s printers

are located in GHC 5404 and GHC 6604. The School of Computer Science provides a number of

black -and-white and color printers for use by students. The SCS Computer Facilities publishes a

list of printers online at http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~help/printing/.
