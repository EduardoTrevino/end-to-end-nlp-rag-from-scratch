Zmigrod et al., 2019) and neutral words list1. We finally compute the "total confidence difference" as the sum of differences in the model’s prediction con- fidence for each gender-word pair (such as confi- dence of predicting he − she, man − woman, etc.). Formally, we define total confidence difference as | (cid:80)N male))| where f (x) rep- resent the confidence of model’s prediction, N is the total number of tokens in the dataset and x is the tokenized gender word. The higher this number,

numerous different countries who must work effectively in a team se tting. The students

invariably come from very different cultures that  have differing attitudes  towards age, gender,

and indicate their preferences. Finally, the  entire LTI faculty meets as a “ Marriage Committee ”

to determine the best set of matches.

Some entering MLT students are prefunded, meaning they have received and accepted a funding letter from a faculty member before the Marriage Process. (Even students who are prefunded must attend the research talks, to become acquainted with the LTI’s rese arch
