Question: In spring 2025, What is the deadline for adding, auditing, and tuition adjustment drop for Mini-3?

Context: The details of the training process are as follows. We started ﬁne-tuning the mT5, by mini- mizing the maximum-likelihood loss for 15 epochs, using a batch size of 8, accumulation steps of 4, and learning rate of 10e-5 with Adafactor optimization and cosine annealing learning rate decay schedule (Loshchilov and Hutter 2016). The maximum news length was set to 512 and max- imum summary length was determined as 120. We initialized our reinforcement learning models with the ﬁne-tuned models that

The third round of interviews was conducted in July and August 2022, and coincided with the soft launch of the beta version of the toolkit. The purpose was to gather feedback to help us refine and finalize the toolkit in preparation for a full launch in the autumn. Five interviews were conducted with participants from all three institutions. This round proved to be very valuable with regard to the functionality of the website and what content we should include or exclude. We asked our
