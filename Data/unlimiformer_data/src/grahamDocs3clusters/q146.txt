Table 2. GTA → Cityscapes results: Classwise and mean (over 16 classes) IoU comparison of our DACS+PAC with prior works. † denotes the use of PSPNet [63], * denotes our implementation of SAC with a restricted conﬁguration (GROUP SIZE=2) compared to original SAC method (GROUP SIZE=4). All other methods use DeepLabV2 [9] architecture.

Architecture. For the 7B model training, we adopt MPT architecture [38], the max sequence length is 2,048. We use Triton [35] with Flash Attention [8] as the self-attention implementation. Alibi is enabled to make model more flexible for input length extrapolation. The model’s total number of parameters is 6.7B. Tokenizer. The tokenizer used for 7B training is adapted GPT-NeoX-20b. Fol- lowing [38], the model’s vocabulary size is adjusted to 50,432 for improved mfu and leaving a few tokens
We used on StudioGAN10 codebase for training GAN in this work. For the StyleGAN and MHGAN architectures, we followed the default hyper-parameters provided in the StudioGAN repository. However, for the BigGAN architecture, we increased the number of training steps to 200,000, which is different from the original hyper-parameters, to increase image ﬁdelity. We trained a total of 256 models for each GAN architecture, with each model being trained on a randomly selected half of the CIFAR-10

complete 144 eligible units of study, including eight 12-unit courses, two 12-unit seminar courses and one 24-unit capstone course. Students must choose at minimum five core courses. The remainder of the 12-unit courses with course numbers 600 or greater can be electives chosen from the SCS course catalog. Any additional non-prerequisite units taken beyond the 144 units are also considered electives.
course. No undergraduat e courses count toward the 195-unit requirement.

All Core courses are organized in sequence, and must be taken in the following order:

Artificial Intelligence and Future Markets (11-651) – No prerequisite.

AI Engineering (11-695) – Prerequisite is the co mpletion of 11-651 with a grade of “B” or

better.

LTI Practicum (11-935) – Three credit units for completing the required Internship.
