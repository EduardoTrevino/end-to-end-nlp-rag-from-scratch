Question: In the BASS paper from Interspeech 2023, what is the improvement in ROUGE-L score demonstrated by the proposed block-wise training method?

Context: For the case of the proposed evaluation models (similarity-based evaluation), we see that train- ing the summarization model with the RL paradigm gives the best results for both the bi-encoder or cross-encoder models (rows 4 and 8 of the results), compared to MLE-only or RL with ROUGE- L score as the reward metric. This is not the case for ROUGE or BERTScore. We thus see that improving the evaluation measure yields an improvement in overall quality of the summaries, as we already showed that
We proposed evaluation measures using similarity scores obtained by ﬁne-tuning the BERTurk model using cross-encoder and bi-encoder model architectures on NLI-TR (Budur et al. 2020) and STSb-TR (Beken Fikri et al. 2021) datasets. We showed that the proposed evaluation measures have better correlations with human evaluations compared to ROUGE scores, according to both Pearson and Spearman correlations. We further showed that using bi-encoder and cross-encoder similarities as rewards improved the
