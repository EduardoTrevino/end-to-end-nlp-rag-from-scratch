Question: What are the two key factors addressed by CSurF?

Context: Paper title: 'CSurF: Sparse Lexical Retrieval through Contextualized Surface Forms' Published year: 2023 Publication venue or conference: International Conference on the Theory of Information Retrieval Authors: Zhen Fan, Jamie Callan, Luyu Gao Summary: This paper proposes to directly bridge the surface form space and the term semantics space in lexical exact-match retrieval via contextualized surface forms (CSF), reaching comparable accuracy as lexical all-to-all soft match systems as an
framing the relation between units and coherence. LFP coherence appears to be

determined by two factors (Schneider et al., 2021): (i) coherence due to the direct

contribution of afferent synaptic inputs; (ii) coherence between the sender LFP and

the summed population spiking activity in the receiver. Coherence therefore depends

on connectivity strength and oscillation power, and does not need purely oscillatory

coupling or spike-phase locking in a receiver.
Participants were also asked to rate which considerations they applied when choosing material. Appropriateness of content and availability through the library were the two most important considerations, with price, simultaneous access and ease of access for students showing as lower considerations.
