Question: In spring 2024, How many units is course 15090 worth?

Context: id 572 1 0 627 1 1 903 1 2 1193 1 3 1542 1 4 ... ... ... 2199072 150 63656179 2199073 150 63807245 2199074 150 64614938 2199075 150 64716982 2199076 150 65355704

page_id quality C FA C B GA ... Start NaN C C C

[2199077 rows x 3 columns]

And now use that to compute the number of documents at each work level:

qwork = qpw.groupby(['id', 'quality'])['page id'].count() qwork

MCDS students must also pass the undergraduate course 15-513 Introduction to Computer Systems (6 units), typically in the summer before their program commences. The student must pass with a grade of B- or better. Failure to pass the course means that the student takes 15-213 during either the fall or spring semester. Note that in both cases the units do not count toward the 144 eligible units of study. Click here to see the MCDS Course Map. Some example courses of study are included below.
There are two course components required for students who elect to complete the M.S. Thesis: 11 -928 – Masters ’ Thesis I (with the chosen thesis advisor, typically for 12 units,

typically in the Fall of their second year) and 11 -929 – Masters ’ Thesis II in the following

Spring.

Each of these two courses counts towards 6 units of MLT -level LTI course credit; if the

student goes on to an LTI PhD, the second course (11 -929) counts towards one PhD lab

requirement.
11-935 – LTI Practicum (3 units). Summer Internship  11-654 – AI Innovation (12 units). Seco nd Fall semester. Only open to MSAII.

11-699 – Capstone Project (36 units). Second Spring  semester. Only open  to MSAII.

3) The Knowledge Area Courses (72 units):

11-601, Coding Bootcamp (12 un its). First fall semester.

10-601, Machine Learning (12 units), First fall semester. (Normally

11-691, Math for Machine Learni ng, which is not being offered in Fall 2022.)
