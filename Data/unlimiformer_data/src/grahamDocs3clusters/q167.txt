Question: According to the paper ChatGPT MT, which languages does the study suggest ChatGPT is especially disadvantaged for?

Context: ability to trans- late it, and suggests that ChatGPT is especially disadvantaged for LRLs and African languages.
4. A decision tree analysis of language features’ correlation with LLM effectiveness in MT, suggesting ChatGPT is especially disadvan- taged for LRLs and African languages

5. A cost comparison across MT systems
We provide benchmarks for LLM ENG→X MT performance across 203 languages, with compar- isons to state-of-the-art commercial and open- source MT models. For many HRLs, LLMs like ChatGPT perform competitively with these tra- ditional models. But for LRLs, traditional MT remains dominant, despite LLMs’ increased pa- rameter size. Our decision-tree analysis reveals language features that predict ChatGPT’s transla- tion effectiveness relative to NLLB, finding that ChatGPT is especially disadvantaged
