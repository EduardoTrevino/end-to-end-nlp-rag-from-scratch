Question: In fall 2023, What are the units for unit 02614?

Context: contextual embeddings. For IWSLT14, a vocabulary consisting of 7,000 BPE (Sen- nrich et al., 2016) units is used, whereas WMT14 employs 32,000 BPE units.

Eq. (2) encapsulates the recurrence relation of the S4 models (Gu et al., 2022; Gupta et al., 2022), S5 model (Smith et al., 2023), and Linear Recurrent Unit (Orvieto et al., 2023). For example, A is in the family of HiPPO matrix (Gu et al., 2023) in S4 or a complex diagonal matrix in Linear Recurrent Unit. We show in Proposition 1 that such input- independent A matrix cannot represent subtraction.

Proposition 1. An input-independent LRNN is in- consistent in representing subtraction.
