Question: How large are the trained models by the authors of SantaCoder paper?

Context: ﬁltering ablations. One of our main ﬁndings was that ﬁltering for Github stars consistently decreased performance across all benchmarks and programming languages. Using the ﬁndings of these abla- tion studies, we trained a ﬁnal 1.1B model—dubbed SantaCoder—for 236B tokens and showed it is able to outperform previous multi-lingual code models (InCoder-6.7B and CodeGen-Multi-2.7B) on both left-to-right generation and inﬁlling tasks. We anticipate that larger architectures and more training data
Using the ﬁndings from these experiments, we train a ﬁnal 1.1B parameter model, dubbed SantaCoder, on Python, JavaScript, and Java. This model obtains comparable or stronger performance than previous open-source multilingual models, InCoder-6.7B and CodeGen- Multi-2.7B, on code generation and inﬁlling tasks on the MultiPL-E benchmark for these three languages, despite being substantially smaller.

6.2 FINAL MODEL

Based on the insights from the architecture and dataset ablations, we train a ﬁnal model, which we call SantaCoder, with MQA and FIM and the two data ﬁlters that yielded the best results: more near- deduplication and comments-to-code ﬁlter. We train this model for 600K iterations (236B tokens) and keep all other hyper-parameters the same.
