Question: In spring 2024, what time does the Subword Modeling class start?

Context: Kudo, 2018; Song et al., 2021). With Sennrich et al. (2016), one starts with a base vocab- ulary of only characters and adds new vocabulary items by recursively merging existing ones based on their frequency statistics in a training corpus. Other approaches judge subword candidates to be included into the vocabulary using a language model (Kudo, 2018; Song et al., 2021). For multilingual models containing data in a variety of scripts, even the base vocabulary of only characters (based on

models (Radford et al., 2019; Devlin et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020). Using subword tokenization also eliminates the need for adaptive softmax (Joulin et al., 2017). It makes the output layer more generalized, sharing more resemblance to the kNN component as described in Section 2, and facilitates the ablation studies in this paper.1 This base LM has 268M parameters. To get a perspective on how large the datastore is, it is built on the training data that contains nearly
