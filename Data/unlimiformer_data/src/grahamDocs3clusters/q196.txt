Question: Is the GRE optional for the Master of Science in Intelligent Information Systems application? Answer yes or no.

Context: Grgurina’s (2008) work is oriented toward the teaching of ICT (Information and Communication Technology), and develops experiences in the teaching of computing at a general level without pointing out didactics as the basis of teaching action

intelligence (SETI) aims to answer this question by looking for evidence of intelligent life elsewhere in the galaxy via the “technosignatures” created by their technology. The majority of technosignature searches to date have been conducted at radio frequencies, given the ease of propagation of radio signals through interstellar space1, as well as the relative efﬁciency of construction of powerful radio transmitters and receivers. One type of technosignatures that is most readily
systems. One area of improvement for Scone is how useful it can be in supplying knowledge to an intelligent agent that can use the knowledge to perform actions and update the knowledge base with its observations.
