Question: What models does ESPnet-ST-v2 offer?

Context: 5.2 Results

Toolkit Comparison Table 2 summarizes ESPnet-ST-v2 performance, showing one best example model (§4) for each task. ESPnet-ST-v1, Fairseq, and NeurST models are also referenced for comparison. On ST/SST, ESPnet-ST-v2 is 4-7 BLEU higher with 4.5 sec lower AL.3 On S2ST ESPnet-ST-v2 is on par with Fairseq.
told, ESPnet-ST-v2 offers the greatest variety across ST, SST, and S2ST – however, we view these toolkits as complementary. The following section elaborates on the unique features of ESPnet-ST-v2.
Figure 1 illustrates the software architecture of ESPnet-ST-v2. This modular design is an improve- ment over the ESPnet-ST-v1 where monolithic model and task definitions made it more difficult to extend and modify the toolkit. We also designed ESPnet-ST-v2 such that modules developed for ad- jacent tasks (e.g. ASR, TTS, MT) can also be readily used for spoken language translation.

Beta’s new design was the winner of the first post-war Design Competition. The buggy, designed by Rick Saxton, was shaped like a bug with welded tubular steel. The real design battle seemed to be between Beta and PiKA, and the Tartan noted that PiKA’s buggy had a better appearance. However, Beta’s was structurally superior and that allowed it to take home the design trophy.
MIIS students gain three types of practical experience: software development supervised by their advisor (24 units equivalent to two courses); a summer internship (which can be waived for students that have sufficient prior professional experience); and a capstone project executed in a group of peers (42 units equivalent to three 12-unit courses and one 6-unit course). This combination is proven to help IIS students to broaden their skills quickly. The MIIS degree is offered in two options:
SAE’s buggy as a “sleek aluminum auto”, and DTD’s letter to the editor in 1951 complaining that if a team had used a “Buick grill” they would have placed in Design Comp, we’ve determined that Buggy #4 (2nd from the left in the Design Comp photo below) is actually SAE’s design winner. For a better look at the design, check out the 1950 photos, which is a similar style (though with different wheels, a different pushbar, and likely some other changes).] 1949 Photos. Here are photos from 1949.
