Question: What is the name of the proposed approach that extends pretrained transformer models to handle unlimited input lengths?

Context: Since the proposal of transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017), these models have been limited to bounded input lengths, because of their need to attend to every token in the input. In this work, we propose Unlimiformer: a general approach that wraps any existing pretrained encoder-decoder transformer, and offloads the cross-attention computation to a single k-nearest-neighbor (kNN) index, while the returned kNN distances are the attention dot-product scores. This kNN index can be kept on either the

Gormley Summary: This work proposes Unlimiformer: a general approach that wraps any existing pretrained encoder-decoder transformer, and offloads the cross-attention computation to a single k-nearest-neighbor (kNN) index, while the returned kNN distances are the attention dot-product scores.
We present Unlimiformer, an approach for augmenting pretrained encoder-decoders and offloading the cross-attention computation to a kNN index, to allow for unlimited length input. Instead of attending to all keys, this kNN index allows every cross-attention head in every decoder layer to retrieve and attend only to its top-k keys. We evaluate Unlimiformer on several long-document and book-summarization benchmarks having inputs of up to 500K tokens, and show that Unlimiformer improves existing
