Question: Does LTI offer a course on ethics?

Context: We start with giving some notation and the problem defi- nition (Section 2), before describing the LTS algorithm, for which we also provide a new lower bound on the number of node expansions (Section 3). Then, we describe parameter- ized context models and explain why we can expect them to work well when using product-of-experts (Section 4), before showing that the LTS loss function is convex for this param- eterization (Section 5) and considering theoretical implica- tions. Finally we present
In their experiments, Orseau and Lelis [2021] showed that LTS+NN performs well on two of the three evaluated do- mains (Sokoban and The Witness), but fails to learn a pol- icy for the 24-Sliding Tile Puzzle (STP). We show that LTS with context models optimized with the LTS loss within the Bootstrap process is able to learn a strong policy for all three domains evaluated, including the STP. We also show that LTS using context models is able to learn a policy that allows it to find solutions to
First of all, we thank our workers on MTurk for their hard work and thoughtful responses. We thank the anonymous reviewers for their helpful com- ments. We also thank Shengyu Feng and mem- bers of the CMU LTI COMEDY group for their feedback, and OpenAI for providing access to the GPT-3.5 API.

by actual classroom courses, not credit given for research or independent study.

An “LTI course ” is any 12 -unit course with a number of 11 -XXX; a  6-unit course with 11 -XXX

counts as one- half of an LTI course. Unless otherwise specified, "course" means an actual

classroom course, not  credit given for research or independent study. Note that the LTI  allow s

any one MLD (10 -XXX) graduate course to count as an "LTI course".
The LTI may grant transfer credit or issue an exemption  for equivalent graduate courses

previously completed at another institution. This decision rests with the chair of the particular program. If a student is exempt  from a required course due to prior courses or experience, the
An LTI Ph.D.  student who uses courses taken as a M aster ’s degree student (at Carnegie Mellon

or elsewhere) toward their program requirements cannot use those same courses toward any

other Master’s degree offered by the school . The LTI (like other SCS units) allows its Ph.D.

students who have passed the requirements for an LTI Master’s degree to receive the master’s

degree without any additional work. Any other sharing of coursework by an LTI student between
