Question: Are there any authors of the paper Understanding Political Polarisation using Language Models: A dataset and method, not from CMU?

Context: Paper title: 'Understanding the Effect of Model Compression on Social Bias in Large Language Models' Published year: 2023 Publication venue or conference: Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing Authors: Emma Strubell, Gustavo Gonçalves Summary: A carefully controlled study of the impact of model compression via quantization and knowledge distillation on measures of social bias in LLMs finds that longer pretraining and larger models led to higher social bias, and
Paper title: 'Generating Images with Multimodal Language Models' Published year: 2023 Publication venue or conference: arXiv.org Authors: Daniel Fried, R. Salakhutdinov, Jing Yu Koh Summary: This work proposes a method to fuse frozen text-only large language models (LLMs) with pre-trained image encoder and decoder models, by mapping between their embedding spaces, and exhibits a wider range of capabilities compared to prior multimodal language models.
Paper title: 'Language Models Get a Gender Makeover: Mitigating Gender Bias with Few-Shot Data Interventions' Published year: 2023 Publication venue or conference: Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics Authors: Louis-Philippe Morency, P. Liang, Praneetha Vaddamanu, Atishay Jain, Himanshu Thakur Summary: This paper empirically shows that by fine-tuning a pre-trained model on only 10 debiased (intervened) training examples, the tendency to favor any gender is

Title: Neural Code Generation:
15. Model checking, 1994 CMU professor Edmund Clarke had long stressed the importance of verifying computer hardware and software through a formal problem-solving technique called “model checking.” In 1994, his arguments gained new weight with the discovery that Intel’s amazing new Pentium chip made errors on certain math problems. Clarke would go on to receive the Turing Award for his role in the development of model checking.
