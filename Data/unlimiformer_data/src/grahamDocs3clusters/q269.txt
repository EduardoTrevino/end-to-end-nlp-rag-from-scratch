Question: What is the full name of the conference where the paper CodeBERTScore: Evaluating Code Generation with Pretrained Models of Code, got published?

Context: Paper title: 'CodeBERTScore: Evaluating Code Generation with Pretrained Models of Code' Published year: 2023 Publication venue or conference: Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing Authors: Sumit Agarwal, Graham Neubig, Uri Alon, Shuyan Zhou Summary: It is found that generated code that receives a higher score by CodeBERTScore is more likely to be preferred by humans, as well as to function correctly when executed, than all existing metrics.

A APPENDIX

A.1 ADDITIONAL ANALYSIS OF OPTIMIZATIONS
In this paper, we present CodeBERTScore, a sim- ple evaluation metric for code generation, which builds on BERTScore (Zhang et al., 2020), using pretrained language models of code, and lever- aging the natural language context of the gen- erated code. We perform an extensive evalua- tion across four programming languages which shows that CodeBERTScore is more correlated with human preference than all prior metrics. Fur- ther, we show that generated code that receives a higher score by

6.3 Conference Travel Funding

Students funded by a research project receive travel funding according to policies set by the

individual projects. Students who have no project funding may be provided with partial funding,

with a larger amount available for travel to presen t a refereed conference paper. There is an LTI

form that must be filled out in advance.

Programming:  This is satisfied by demonstrating competence in computer programming

of language technology; this is normally satisfied in the course of the student's research

and/or project work.
