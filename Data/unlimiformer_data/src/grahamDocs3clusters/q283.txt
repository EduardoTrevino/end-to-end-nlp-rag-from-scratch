Abstract

three events (Q602744, Q8641370, Q216184) themselves constitute a hierarchical event structure.
3 Hierarchical Event Grounding The task of grounding involves linking event references in text documents to the corresponding entries in a knowl- edge base (Chandu, Bisk, and Black 2021). Pratapa, Gupta, and Mitamura (2022) studied linking event references from Wikipedia and Wikinews articles to Wikidata items. How- ever, they restrict the dictionary of Wikidata items to leaf events. This ignores important parent events such as ‘Op- eration Overlord’ and ‘Western Front (World War II)’ from
1 Introduction Grounding entity and event references from documents to a large-scale knowledge base (KB) is an important compo- nent in the information extraction stack. While entity linking has been extensively explored in the literature (Ji and Grish- man 2011), event linking is relatively unexplored.2 Recently, Pratapa, Gupta, and Mitamura (2022) presented a dataset for linking event references from Wikipedia and Wikinews arti- cles to Wikidata KB. However, this work limited the ground- ing
