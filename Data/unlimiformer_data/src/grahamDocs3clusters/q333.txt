Question: In summer 2024, What is the deadline for adding, auditing, and tuition adjustment drop for Mini-5?

Context: The details of the training process are as follows. We started ﬁne-tuning the mT5, by mini- mizing the maximum-likelihood loss for 15 epochs, using a batch size of 8, accumulation steps of 4, and learning rate of 10e-5 with Adafactor optimization and cosine annealing learning rate decay schedule (Loshchilov and Hutter 2016). The maximum news length was set to 512 and max- imum summary length was determined as 120. We initialized our reinforcement learning models with the ﬁne-tuned models that
which are presented in § A.3 Table 5. For MiniLM-L6-30M, the all-domain pre-training improves the best-seed accuracy in all cases. For DeBERTA-v3-435M, there is either a substantial degradation or a small decrease/increase that is not statistically significant (denoted by super-script label “c”). Thus, our biggest model—unlike a 15x smaller MiniLM-L6-30M—does not benefit from all-domain pretraining. However, there is no substantial degradation either.
