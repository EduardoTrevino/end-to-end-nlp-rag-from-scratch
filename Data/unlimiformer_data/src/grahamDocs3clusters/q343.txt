Question: What professor was the last author on "Deriving Vocal Fold Oscillation Information from Recorded Voice Signals Using Models of Phonation"?

Context: Paper title: 'Deriving Vocal Fold Oscillation Information from Recorded Voice Signals Using Models of Phonation' Published year: 2023 Publication venue or conference: Entropy Authors: Wayne Zhao, Rita Singh Summary: A novel analysis-by-synthesis approach that allows us to infer the VFOs directly from recorded speech signals on an individualized, speaker- by-speaker basis is proposed and it is shown how the V FOs can be quantified from a dynamical systems perspective for classification purposes.
Paper title: 'A Gene-Based Algorithm for Identifying Factors That May Affect a Speaker’s Voice' Published year: 2023 Publication venue or conference: Entropy Authors: Rita Singh Summary: A simple path-finding algorithm that attempts to find links between vocal characteristics and perturbing factors using cytogenetic and genomic data and shows that in cases where strong links are exposed, vocal characteristics of the patients are indeed reported to be correspondingly affected.

4. Speech recognition, 1976 If you have an iPhone, ask Siri to look up “Hearsay I,” the first computer system capable of continuous speech recognition. It was developed by future Turing Award winner and future SCS dean Raj Reddy along with his students. Their work on subsequent systems established many of the principles that still underlie speech recognition software.
