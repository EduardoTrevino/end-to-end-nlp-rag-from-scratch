Question: How much does it cost to apply for the MLT program if an application is submitted on November 20th, 2023?

Context: Cost of Query Generation. For the original InPars Bonifacio et al. (2022), the cost of generation for the GPT-3 Curie model is $0.002 per one thousand tokens. The token count includes the length of the prompt and the prompting document.14 We estimate that (depending on the collection) a single generation involves 300 to 500 tokens: long-document collections Robust04 and TREC-COVID both have close to 500 tokens per generation.
receive 6 scores, and we use the average score as the final score for each response. The response with the higher final score is considered the better response. The GPT-4 evaluation incurred a cost of $20.45 for InstructBlip and $20.90 for MiniGPT-4.
