Question: How many datasets does GlobalBench currently cover?

Context: for different tasks. MultiBench spans 10 diverse modalities (images, video, audio, text, time-series, various robotics sensors, sets, and tables), 15 prediction tasks (humor, sentiment, emotions, mortality rate, ICD-9 codes, image-captions, human activities, digits, robot pose, object pose, robot contact, and design interfaces), and 5 research areas (affective computing, healthcare, multimedia, robotics, and HCI). These datasets are designed to test a combination of feature learning and
Fusion experiments: In Table 6 and 7 we present more detailed results on the Multibench [44] and IRFL [87] datasets computed from 5 independent runs. FACTORCL significantly outperforms the baselines that do not capture both shared and unique information in both supervised and self- supervised settings, particularly on MUSTARD (where unique information expresses sarcasm, such as sardonic facial expressions or ironic tone of voice), and on MIMIC (with unique health indicators and sensor
Table 6: Results of six dataset combination configurations of 1.3B models and our LBS-7B model details are presented in Sec. 6. Bigbench is evaluated under 3-shot using the average of multiple choice grade. Arc easy and arc challenge are evaluated using 5-shot, 25-shot, and 25-shot, respectively. All other eval- uation benchmarks are tested on 0-shot. * represents the results are averaged across multiple sub-items inside each benchmark dataset.
