Question: Who generates ValuePrism's contextualized values?

Context: To examine how context can be leveraged for explaining offensiveness, we train CHARM, a Context-aware Harm Reasoning Model, using COBRACORPUS. Through context-aware and context-agnostic model ablations, we show per- formance improvements with the use of context when generating COBRA explanations, as mea- sured by automatic and human evaluations. Surpris- ingly, on the challenging counterfactual contexts (COBRACORPUS-CF), CHARM surpasses the per- formance of GPT-3.5—which provided CHARM’s
Shapley values (Hart, 1989), originating from co- operative game theory, have emerged as a powerful model-agnostic tool to explain the predictions of machine learning models. This approach provides a way to fairly distribute the contribution of each feature to the overall prediction for a specific in- stance. By calculating the Shapley value for each feature, we gain insight into the importance of in- dividual features within the context of a specific prediction. This interpretability technique
4 COBRACORPUS-CF: Generating

Counterfactual Contexts

To examine the limits of context-aware ex- planations generate COBRACORPUS-CF, a challenge set of counterfac- tual context pairs that invert the offensiveness of statements, inspired by adversarial and counterfac- tual test sets in NLP (Gardner et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020; Chang et al., 2021). Illustrated in Figure 1, our motivating question asks, how does the toxicity of a statement change with a different context?
