Table 2. GTA → Cityscapes results: Classwise and mean (over 16 classes) IoU comparison of our DACS+PAC with prior works. † denotes the use of PSPNet [63], * denotes our implementation of SAC with a restricted conﬁguration (GROUP SIZE=2) compared to original SAC method (GROUP SIZE=4). All other methods use DeepLabV2 [9] architecture.

single iteration of pre-training (80.9 and 80.8 vs 80.7). These results indicate that features used for the ini- tial cluster assignments had a significant effect on downstream performance. GS-16 had significant gains in semantic-related tasks and ASR. However, this came at the cost of performance in other categories, such as detection. On the other hand, GS-8 obtained scores that were more even across the board, having less degradation on detection-related tasks.

In our experiments, we encode both the vision and text modalities using Transformer encoders with 5 heads and 5 layers, and map them to 40-dimensional embeddings. We train the model for 100 epochs using the Adam optimizer with a 1e-4 learning rate.

Learning for Language Technologies Part-time education option is available in some cases. MIIS-16 students must take at least 84 units (typically 7 courses) of qualifying and elective courses that satisfy human language, machine learning, and language technology applications breadth requirements.
MIIS-21 students have to take at least two more courses from the selected concentration area to satisfy their degree requirements, making it total of 108 units (typically 9 courses) of qualifying and elective courses, that also satisfy breadth requirements. For a full list of requirements, read the MIIS Handbook. Curriculum: Click one of the two options below:
