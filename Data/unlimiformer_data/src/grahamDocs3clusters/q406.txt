I am good at sports, maths and physics. What course should I pursue at university? While academic aptitudes alone aren’t enough to determine which major is best suited for you, having strengths in areas like mathematics, science, and engineering certainly suggests potential overlap with certain fields. Some popular courses of study within those domains include computer science, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, economics, finance, and physical sciences like chemistry and physics

3.3.6.3 Areas of Concentration In addition to the common MCDS core, all students must complete at least one area of concentration, which consists of three courses in Analytics, Systems, or Human- Centered Data Science. Students consult with their academic advisor and choose one or more areas of concentration during their first semester, in preparation for enrolling in Spring classes.
also complete at least one concentration, consisting of three courses in one of three areas: Analytics, Systems, or Human-Centered Data Science. The remaining elective course can be any course with number 600 or above chosen from the SCS course catalog. Any additional non-prerequisite units taken beyond the 144 units are also considered electives.  To maintain full-time enrollment status, a student must enroll in a minimum of 36 course units per semester.
