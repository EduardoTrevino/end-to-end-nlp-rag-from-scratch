Question: What is the publicly available website for WebArena

Context: from perfect performance in these real-life tasks, and that WebArena can be used to measure such progress. Our code, data, environment reproduction resources, and video demonstrations are publicly available at https://webarena.dev/.
Figure 1: WebArena is a standalone, self-hostable web environment for building autonomous agents. WebArena creates websites from four popular categories with functionality and data mimicking their real-world equivalents. To emulate human problem-solving, WebArena also embeds tools and knowledge resources as independent websites. WebArena introduces a benchmark on interpreting high-level realistic natural language command to concrete web-based interactions. We provide annotated programs designed
We introduce WebArena, a realistic and reproducible web environment designed to facilitate the development of autonomous agents capable of executing tasks (§2). An overview of WebArena is in Figure 1. Our environment comprises four fully operational, self-hosted web applications, each representing a distinct domain prevalent on the internet: online shopping, discussion forums, collaborative development, and business content management. Furthermore, WebArena incorporates several utility tools,
