Question: How many Chemical Engineering courses are going to be held in Summer 2024?

Context: We are very excited to bring you the proceedings of the 15th edition of the International Symposium on Search-Based Software Engineering (SSBSE 2023). SSBSE is a premier event for all who are interested in the intersection of search optimization and difﬁcult software engineering problems spanning numerous domains. This year SSBSE was held as a hybrid event; physically located in San Francisco, California, USA and remote for those that were unable to attend in person. We continue to be
the “International Conference on Interactive Collaborative Learning” and the “47th edition of the International Conference on Engineering-Pedagogy” held in 2018 the “Aristotle University of Thessaloniki of Greece,” they at published a text with the papers presented entitled “The Challenges of the Digital Transformation in Education,” in which among the many papers presented, a section on research conducted on preschool, primary and secondary education stands out. Some of the titles observed
Speaking for the SSBSE 2023 Program Committee, we are delighted to introduce the pro- ceedings of the 15th International Symposium on Search-Based Software Engineering. Search-Based Software Engineering (SBSE) focuses on formulating various optimiza- tion problems in software engineering as search problems and then addressing them with search techniques, intending to automate complex software engineering tasks. A wide class of software engineering challenges can be formulated into SBSE
