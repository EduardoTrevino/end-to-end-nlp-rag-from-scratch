Iterative self -refinement is a fundamental characteristic of human problem-solving (Simon, 1962; Flower and Hayes, 1981; Amabile, 1983). Iterative self-refinement is a process that involves creating an initial draft and subsequently refining it based on self-provided feedback. For example, when

At least two LTI faculty members will attend the presentation, including the research advisor.

After the presentation, these faculty members will convene and provide written feedback to both the student and the Program Director  of graduate programs (the form for this is available on the

LTI website). This feedback will help the student refine speaking skills with respect to talk

structure, content,  and delivery.

3.2 Advising
At least two CMU faculty members will attend the presentation, including the research advisor.

After the presentation, these faculty members will convene and provide written feedback to both the student and the chair of graduate programs (the form for this is available on the LTI website). This feedback will help the student refine speaking skills with respect to talk structure, content, and delivery.
