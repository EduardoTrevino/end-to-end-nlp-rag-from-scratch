Scone is implemented in Common Lisp and has been under development in Carnegie Mellon University’s (CMU’s) Language Technologies Institute since around 2003. A tutorial book on the design and usage of Scone is in the process of being written. Until it is published, more information about Scone can be found in Fahlman’s Knowledge Nuggets blog [8].
