Question: What does SHAP mean in SHAP-based Prediction of Mother's History of Depression to Understand the Influence on Child Behavior?

Context: The SHAP method works by evaluating the model’s prediction for each instance while permuting the values of a specific feature. This involves shuffling the values of the chosen feature while keeping the rest of the features unchanged. The difference between the model’s prediction with the original feature values and the prediction with the

We first query the LLM for a possible reason why the words detected by the SHAP analysis would lower the regard of the given sentence. We then take that reason and
