for different tasks. MultiBench spans 10 diverse modalities (images, video, audio, text, time-series, various robotics sensors, sets, and tables), 15 prediction tasks (humor, sentiment, emotions, mortality rate, ICD-9 codes, image-captions, human activities, digits, robot pose, object pose, robot contact, and design interfaces), and 5 research areas (affective computing, healthcare, multimedia, robotics, and HCI). These datasets are designed to test a combination of feature learning and
We use LLaVA-Bench (Liu et al., 2023a) and our MMHAL-BENCH as our main evaluation met- rics for their high alignment with human preferences. In addition, we conducted tests on widely- recognized Large Multimodal Model benchmarks. We employed MMBench (Liu et al., 2023b), a multi-modal benchmark offering an objective evaluation framework comprising 2,974 multiple- choice questions spanning 20 ability dimensions. This benchmark utilizes ChatGPT to juxtapose model predictions against desired
