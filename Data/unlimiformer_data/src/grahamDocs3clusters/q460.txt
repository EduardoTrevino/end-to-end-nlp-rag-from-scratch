Question: What is the code URL for the case studies presented in the framework tax paper?

Context: this phenomenon as the framework tax, and ob- serve that the disparity is growing as hard- ware speed increases over time. In this work, we examine this phenomenon through a se- ries of case studies analyzing the effects of model design decisions, framework paradigms, and hardware platforms on total model latency. Code is available at https://github.com/ JaredFern/Framework-Tax.
Paper title: 'The Framework Tax: Disparities Between Inference Efficiency in Research and Deployment' Published year: 2023 Publication venue or conference: Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing Authors: Emma Strubell, Yonatan Bisk, Jacob Kahn, Clara Na, Jared Fernandez Summary: This work examines the effects of model design decisions, framework paradigms, and hardware platforms on total model latency through a series of case studies analyzing the effects of model design
In the case studies in sections 5.2 and 5.3 we use the "PPO-CB" exploration bonus. The case study in section 5.4 requires raw PPO for the purposes of the study, and one in section 5.5 uses LLMs as agents. In appnedix F, we use PPO-CB and PPO-CBL (in those case-studies in which the peer provides linguistic feedback).
