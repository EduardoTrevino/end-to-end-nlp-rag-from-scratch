Question: Where was "End-to-End Speech Recognition: A Survey" published?

Context: Paper title: 'End-to-End Speech Recognition: A Survey' Published year: 2023 Publication venue or conference: IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio Speech and Language Processing Authors: Tara N. Sainath, R. Schluter, Takaaki Hori, Shinji Watanabe, Rohit Prabhavalkar Summary: A taxonomy of E2E ASR models and corresponding improvements is provided, and their properties and their relationship to classical hidden Markov model (HMM) based ASR architectures are discussed.

4. Speech recognition, 1976 If you have an iPhone, ask Siri to look up “Hearsay I,” the first computer system capable of continuous speech recognition. It was developed by future Turing Award winner and future SCS dean Raj Reddy along with his students. Their work on subsequent systems established many of the principles that still underlie speech recognition software.
