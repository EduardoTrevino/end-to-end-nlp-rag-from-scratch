Question: In fall 2024, What is the last day of Mini-1 classes?

Context: Mini GPT-4 [Zhu et al., 2023] uses a pretrained Q-Former module from [Li et al., 2023] to project images encoded by EVA CLIP ViT-G/14 [Fang et al., 2022] to Vicuna’s [Chiang et al., 2023] text embedding space. Both CLIP and Vicuna are frozen, while a section of the Q-former is finetuned on a subset of LAION [Schuhmann et al., 2021], Conceptual Captions [Sharma et al., 2018], SBU [Ordonez et al., 2011], and multimodal instruction-following data generated by the authors.
Sachan et al. (2022) evaluated their method using only QA (but not IR) datasets and their main results are for an impractically large three-billion parameter instruction-finetuned model, which was used essentially as a re-ranker (in a zero-shot scenario). The smallest model used by Sachan et al. (2022) had 250 million parameters (compared to our 30-million MiniLM model). It was evaluated only on the Natural Questions (NQ) collection (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019) where it outperformed BM25 by about
(Dai et al., 2023). Otter (Li et al., 2023b;a) focuses on enhancing OpenFlamingo’s instruction-following capability. MiniGPT-4 (Zhu et al., 2023) suggests GPT4’s prowess is due to sophisticated LLMs and recommends using a sin- gle project layer to align visual and linguistic models. It showcases abilities akin to GPT4 but is computationally efficient. mPLUG-Owl (Ye et al., 2023) offers a new approach: initially aligning
