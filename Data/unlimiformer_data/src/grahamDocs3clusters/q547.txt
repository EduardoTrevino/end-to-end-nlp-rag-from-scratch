Question: What are the four categories of low-level acoustic descriptors used in the TAP loss?

Context: where Lf t/Lf t are finetuning/pretraining loss functions, Df t/Dpt are finetuning/pretraining datasets, and w(·; λ) is the data reweighting network. Following the experiment setup in TARTAN [11], we use task-specific data and a masked language modeling loss in our auxiliary task and perform experiments with RoBERTa-base on 4 datasets from the original DAPT/TAPT paper. We compare our SAMA- based data optimization against DAPT and TARTAN-MT. We exclude TAPT and TARTAN-Meta respectively because
to perform evaluations of four metrics: SSIM, FSIM, MSE, and PSNR. No training is performed, and the weights of the encoder and the decoder are frozen.

In Fig. 9, we show the reconstruction analysis using the origi- nal patch size design in MAE. Similar to the result in the main text, higher patch sizes produce image reconstructions capturing high- level similarities better, while low patch sizes have reconstructions better on low-level metrics.
port level in play when the model over-generated and under-generated hedges. Since rapport is anno- tated from 1 to 7 in the dataset, for convenience, we divided it into 3 levels: high (5-7), medium (3-5), and low rapport (1-3), as shown in Table 3.
