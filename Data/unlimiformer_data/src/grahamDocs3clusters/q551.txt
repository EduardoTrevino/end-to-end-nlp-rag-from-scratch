Question: In fall 2024, What is the deadline for Mini-1 voucher election?

Context: Mini GPT-4 [Zhu et al., 2023] uses a pretrained Q-Former module from [Li et al., 2023] to project images encoded by EVA CLIP ViT-G/14 [Fang et al., 2022] to Vicuna’s [Chiang et al., 2023] text embedding space. Both CLIP and Vicuna are frozen, while a section of the Q-former is finetuned on a subset of LAION [Schuhmann et al., 2021], Conceptual Captions [Sharma et al., 2018], SBU [Ordonez et al., 2011], and multimodal instruction-following data generated by the authors.
We follow Liu et al. (2022) to choose k-NN exam- ples from the training corpus. The demonstrations are encoded by all-MiniLM-L6-v2. For LMs with maximum context length as 2048, we set k to 32; and for LMs with maximum context length as 1024, we set k to 16.

We conduct other baselines with the code imple- mented by Meng et al. (2022a). 1 We simply add the preﬁx Prompt: in prompts and report the re- sults conducted by us.
