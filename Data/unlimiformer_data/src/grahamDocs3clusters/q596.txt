standard course, because they provide a good introduction to the broad range of research done at

the LTI. Students do not register for the LTI Orientation, nor do they receive a grade; however, the department is serious about its expectation that new students will attend these talks.

For many years, these talks were called "the Immigration Course (IC)." The intuition behind this

name is that the talks help orient newly -arrived students – immigrants into the CMU
by actual classroom courses, not credit given for research or independent study.

An “LTI course ” is any 12 -unit course with a number of 11 -XXX; a  6-unit course with 11 -XXX

counts as one- half of an LTI course. Unless otherwise specified, "course" means an actual

classroom course, not  credit given for research or independent study. Note that the LTI  allow s

any one MLD (10 -XXX) graduate course to count as an "LTI course".
