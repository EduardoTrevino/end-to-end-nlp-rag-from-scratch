Specifically, we fix batch size as 8, learning rate as 5e-6, and epochs as 6 for ANCE while taking batch size as 8, learning rate as 1e-5, and epochs as 3 for Contriever. We choose their best checkpoints based on the perfor- mance of the development set. The information about our source tasks and target tasks are listed
