Question: What are the benefits of using IPA over fine-tuning?

Context: ability of RL with the plug-and-play flexibility of inference-time techniques, permitting customiza- tion of large language models without the need for costly fine-tuning. Extensive experiments across five challenging text generation tasks show that IPA brings consistent improvements over LLMs, outperforming competitive baselines — sometimes even surpassing expensive fine-tuning. We hope our work sheds light on creative and efficient algo- rithmic innovations to complement the pursuit of model
On five challenging text generation tasks, such as toxicity reduction and lexically constrained generation, IPA consistently brings significant improvements over off-the-shelf language mod- els. It outperforms competitive baseline meth- ods, sometimes even including expensive fine- tuning. In particular, tailoring GPT-2 with IPA can outperform GPT-3, while tailoring GPT- 3 with IPA brings a major performance boost over GPT-3 (and sometimes even over GPT-4). Our promising results highlight the
