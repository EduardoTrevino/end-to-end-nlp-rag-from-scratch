et al. (2022), who observed that only monoT5-3B (but not a much smaller monoT5-220M) outperformed BM25 on all collections. Strong performance of MiniLM-L6-30M in our study was due to additional training with consistency-checked data and pre-training on all-domain data (all queries from all collections). To confirm the effectiveness of these procedures, we carried out ablation experiments.
Not only were we able to reproduce key findings from prior work (Bonifacio et al., 2022), but, combining the original InPars recipe (Bonifacio et al., 2022) with (1) fine-tuning on consistency-checked data (Dai et al., 2022) and (2) all-domain pretraining, we trained an efficient yet small model MiniLM-L6-30M consistently outperforming BM25 in the unsupervised setting. In the same scenario, using a larger DeBERTA-v3-435M model, we largely matched performance of a 7x larger monoT5-3B.
