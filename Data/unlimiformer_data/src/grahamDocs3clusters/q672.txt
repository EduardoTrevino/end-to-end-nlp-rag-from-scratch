Question: What number do all of the Chemistry classes start with?

Context: The ﬁrst iteration was run for batches of size 10 (7 batches). Table 6 shows the results for the top N questions ranked, with N equal to 5, 10, and 20, and for the two conﬁgurations selected, averaging the results obtained in all but the ﬁrst batch, as the learning phase only starts after acquiring data from the ﬁrst batch.
5.2 Few-shot Experiments

We formulate few-shot transfer learning as an N - way K-shot problem, where a model is trained on K instances of each of the N classes in the target domain. We experiment with K ∈ {1, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100}. Because of the label im- balance in our datasets, where K is greater than the number of labeled examples for a given class, we sample all of the labeled instances without replace- ment. This can result in fewer than K examples for a given class.
4Feature numbers start from 1. 5We report results for these two values as mild and severe cases of group bias. Our experiments with other values led to consistent results.

complete 144 eligible units of study, including eight 12-unit courses, two 12-unit seminar courses and one 24-unit capstone course. Students must choose at minimum five core courses. The remainder of the 12-unit courses with course numbers 600 or greater can be electives chosen from the SCS course catalog. Any additional non-prerequisite units taken beyond the 144 units are also considered electives.

also complete at least one concentration, consisting of three courses in one of three areas: Analytics, Systems, or Human-Centered Data Science. The remaining elective course can be any course with number 600 or above chosen from the SCS course catalog. Any additional non-prerequisite units taken beyond the 144 units are also considered electives.  To maintain full-time enrollment status, a student must enroll in a minimum of 36 course units per semester.
