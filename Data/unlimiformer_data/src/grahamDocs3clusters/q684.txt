Abstract

sided die, we found that it only returns 14 of the 20 options, even though all should be equally likely.
Language models are increasingly being incorporated into web applications and other user-facing tools.1 These applications typically do not provide direct access to the underlying language model or the decoding configuration used for generation. In this paper, we show how even in this blackbox setting, it is possible to identify the decoding strategy employed for generation. We consider the case where one only has access to a system that inputs a prompt and out- puts a generated response. We

12. Java, 1991 As a CMU grad student, James Gosling (CS’83) worked on the Andrew project, which stressed interoperability between computers, whether they were Macs, IBMs or Unix machines. Those lessons served Gosling well when he developed Java, the first programming language able to run on almost any platform.
4. Speech recognition, 1976 If you have an iPhone, ask Siri to look up “Hearsay I,” the first computer system capable of continuous speech recognition. It was developed by future Turing Award winner and future SCS dean Raj Reddy along with his students. Their work on subsequent systems established many of the principles that still underlie speech recognition software.
