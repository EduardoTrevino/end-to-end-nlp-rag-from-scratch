Question: What is the proposed approach in the paper "Rethinking Voice-Face Correlation: A Geometry View"?

Context: To investigate and understand the voice-face correlation at a more fine-grained phoneme level, we propose an anal- ysis pipeline that leverages a common feature extractor with a regression head to predict human anthropometric measure- ments (AM) from phoneme. Specifically, Human anthropomet- ric measurements are a set of facial measurements summarized from cognitive science studies that can effectively represent the identity of a human. We decompose the audio recordings into phonemes and learn
and movements in the face. Therefore, it is advanta- geous to discover the hidden link between phonemes and face attributes. In this paper, we propose an analysis pipeline to help us explore the voice-face relationship in a fine-grained manner, i.e., phonemes vs. facial anthropometric measurements (AM). We build an estimator for each phoneme-AM pair and evaluate the correlation through hypothesis testing. Our results indicate that AMs are more predictable from vowels compared to conso- nants,
by using advanced Generative Adversarial Networks [12]. Go- ing beyond, recent works [13, 14] attempt to recover 3D face geometry meshes from voice to avoid the impact of inevitable background area modeling in 2D images. However, all these approaches rely on a long period of voice and potentially ne- glect the advantage of exploring a more fine-grained voice-face correspondence.
