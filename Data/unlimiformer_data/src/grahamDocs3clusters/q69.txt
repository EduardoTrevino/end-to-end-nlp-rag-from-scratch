KB-based QA We prompt ChatGPT or GPT-4 to generate two search engine queries from each claim ci. These queries are intended to help humans in verifying the factuality of ci. Detailed prompting instructions can be found in Appendix A.

Code Generation We consider each generated code snippet within the response as a single claim to be verified. We extract all such code snippets that are enclosed with brackets, in other words, within a code block.
