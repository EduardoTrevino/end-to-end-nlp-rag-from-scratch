Question: In summer 2024, When is the first day of Mini-6 classes?

Context: 2023a). Remarkably, when integrated with the SELF-ALIGN technique (Sun et al., 2023b), our method enabled the training of a self-aligned AI-assistant agent, namely Dromedary-2, from scratch by only manually crafting 6 exemplars for In-Context Learning (Brown et al., 2020) and a combined total of 31 principles (17 from SELF-ALIGN and 14 for SALMON). Despite its mini- mal human supervision design, our model outperformed the extensively RLHF-trained LLaMA-2- Chat model (Touvron et al., 2023b),

Mini GPT-4 [Zhu et al., 2023] uses a pretrained Q-Former module from [Li et al., 2023] to project images encoded by EVA CLIP ViT-G/14 [Fang et al., 2022] to Vicuna’s [Chiang et al., 2023] text embedding space. Both CLIP and Vicuna are frozen, while a section of the Q-former is finetuned on a subset of LAION [Schuhmann et al., 2021], Conceptual Captions [Sharma et al., 2018], SBU [Ordonez et al., 2011], and multimodal instruction-following data generated by the authors.
