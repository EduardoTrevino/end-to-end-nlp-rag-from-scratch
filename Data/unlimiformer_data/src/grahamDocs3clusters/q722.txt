Question: What is the proposed method for grounding pre-trained text-only language models to the visual domain?

Context: Abstract We propose an efficient method to ground pre- trained text-only language models to the visual domain, enabling them to process arbitrarily in- terleaved image-and-text data, and generate text interleaved with retrieved images. Our method leverages the abilities of language models learnt from large scale text-only pretraining, such as in-context learning and free-form text generation. We keep the language model frozen, and fine- tune input and output linear layers to enable cross-
We propose a method to visually ground pretrained frozen language models through efficient finetuning of several lin- ear layers. Our model, FROMAGe, is capable of producing coherent interleaved image-text outputs. We show strong zero-shot performance on a variety of tasks involving image- text inputs and outputs, and qualitatively showcase interac- tive abilities such as multimodal dialogue. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for bootstrap- ping general purpose
We proposed a method of mapping text-only LLMs to strong visual models. This enables them to learn to process arbitrarily interleaved image-and-text inputs, and output generated text, retrieved images, and generated images. We show that it is possible to efficiently learn a mapping between the embeddings of a frozen pretrained LLM and a frozen pretrained image generation model, and that doing so effectively boosts image generation for tasks that require stronger language context dependence.

Requirements: Students interested in the language technologies minor must complete our prerequisite courses with an average grade of B (3.0) or better before applying to the program. (Students who do not meet this average must submit a letter of explanation along with their application.) Prerequisites include: - Principles of Imperative Computation (15-122) - Principles of Functional Programming (15-150)
Information retrieval, machine translation and speech technology are used daily by the general public, while text mining, natural language processing and language-based tutoring are common within more specialized professional or educational environments. The LTI prepares students for this world by offering a minor that gives you the opportunity to not only learn about language technologies, but to also apply that knowledge through a directed project.
