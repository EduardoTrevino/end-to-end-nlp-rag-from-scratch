Question: What is reciprocal rank used to measure?

Context: ABSTRACT Across a variety of ranking tasks, researchers use reciprocal rank to measure the effectiveness for users interested in exactly one relevant item. Despite its widespread use, evidence suggests that reciprocal rank is brittle when discriminating between systems. This brittleness, in turn, is compounded in modern evaluation set- tings where current, high-precision systems may be difficult to distinguish. We address the lack of sensitivity of reciprocal rank by introducing and connecting
single item. Over the years, reciprocal rank (and less so ESL1) has established itself as a core metric for retrieval [5] and recommendation [4], adopted in situations where there is actually only one relevant item as well as in situations where there are multiple relevant items. Given two rankings, reciprocal rank and ESL1 always agree in terms of which ranking is better. Because of this, we refer to them collectively as the recall level 1 or RL1 metrics.
Despite the widespread use of reciprocal rank, recent evidence suggests that it may brittle when it comes to discriminating between ranking systems [10, 19, 20]. In particular, the low number of unique values of reciprocal rank means that, especially when evaluating multiple highly-performing systems, we are likely to observe tied performance. Voorhees et al. [21] demonstrate that these conditions exist in many modern deep learning benchmarks.
