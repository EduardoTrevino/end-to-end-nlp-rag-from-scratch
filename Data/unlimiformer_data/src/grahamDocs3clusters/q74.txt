Question: How many months is the longer track of the MIIS program?

Context: We estimate the total GPU time for results presented in this paper did not exceed approximately 116 days of time on a single 48-GB A6000. The longest-training models, SLED and retrieval training for GovReport, took approximately 10 days to train.
>360 times speedup, from ∼6.5 months to ∼13 hours.
In order to evaluate the applicability of our approach, we analyze its cost. Figure 8 shows a boxplot of the time taken in hours for our experiments. We find that the time taken varies a lot between different benchmarks and in some cases even across different runs on the same benchmark. We find that MO-GI takes between 0.1 hours and 20.6 hours, with a median time across the benchmarks of 2.6 hours. The main source of variation across the benchmarks is the difference in time taken by the test

Option 1. Standard MIIS degree (MIIS-16) - A 16-month track that is completed in three academic semesters (fall, spring, fall) and a summer internship. Option 2. MIIS: Advanced Study degree (MIIS-21) - A 21-month track that is completed in four academic semesters (fall, spring, fall, spring) and a summer internship. MIIS: Advanced Study track offers indepth degree in one of the following areas of concentration: Human Language for Language Technologies Language Technology Application Machine
The MIIS degree is offered in  two options:

Option 1. Standard MIIS degree  (MIIS -16) - A 16 -month track that is completed in three

academic semesters (fall, spring, fall) and a summer internship.

Option 2. MIIS: Advanced Study degree  (MIIS -21) - A 21 -month track that is completed in

four academic semesters (fall, spring, fall, spring) and a summer internship.

MIIS: Advanced Study track offers in depth  degree in one of the following areas of

concentration:
