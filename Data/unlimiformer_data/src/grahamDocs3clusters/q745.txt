Question: What was  H. John Heinz III College previously called?

Context: correlation volume between the features extracted by the two encoders as described in Sec. III-A. The correlation volume is then fed into a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) that iteratively refines the estimated flow map. Each iteration i of the GRU update outputs a flow update ∆fi, which is added to the previous flow estimate fi−1 to obtain the updated flow map fi. Following [30], we employ an additional context encoder that extracts features only from the LiDAR BEV image, which is additionally fed
