Question: How many test examples are included in the WebArena benchmark?

Context: We provide a benchmark with 812 test examples on grounding high-level natural language instructions to interactions in WebArena. Each example has a metric to evaluate the functional correctness of the task execution. In this section, we first formally define the task of controlling an autonomous agent through natural language. Then we introduce the annotation process of our benchmark.

3.1

INTENT COLLECTION
We present WebArena, a highly-realistic, standalone, and reproducible web environment designed for the development and testing of autonomous agents. WebArena includes fully functional web applications and genuine data from four major categories, providing a realistic platform for agent interaction. It further supports a wide range of tools and external knowledge bases, fostering a focus on human-like problem-solving. Additionally, we curate a comprehensive benchmark consisting of 812 examples
Along with WebArena, we release a ready-to-use benchmark with 812 long-horizon web-based tasks (§3). Each task is described as a high-level natural language intent, emulating the abstract language usage patterns typically employed by humans (Bisk et al., 2019). Two example intents are shown in the upper left of Figure 1. We focus on evaluating the functional correctness of these tasks, i.e., does the result of the execution actually achieve the desired goal (§3.2). For instance, to evaluate the
