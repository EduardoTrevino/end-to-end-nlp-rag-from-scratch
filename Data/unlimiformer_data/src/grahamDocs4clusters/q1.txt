Question: What's the course number for large language models methods and application?

Context: 7.4 Large Batch Training for Large Language Models
Large language models. As large language model parameter count, training dataset size, and training duration have been increased, the models have been found to exhibit complex behaviors [Brown et al., 2020, Wei et al., 2022b, Ganguli et al., 2022]. In this work, we focus on models trained with causal “next-word” prediction, and use the notation s ← Gen(x) to a language model emitting a sequence of tokens s given a prompt x. Many applications of language models take advantage of emergent
2.2 Large Language Models Large language models [15] have their origins in the progressive evolution of machine learning algorithms and natural language processing techniques. They mark a significant advancement from traditional rule-based systems, employing deep learning architectures such as Transformers [60], in- troduced by Vaswani et al. in 2017. Application domains for these models are diverse, encompassing machine translation, text generation, sentiment analysis, summarization, and more.

Today, it takes six people to maneuver the .84 -mile course around Schenley Park's Flagstaff Hill.

But while five pushers and a driver navigate the course's hills, dozens of people are needed to make a successful race happen. A year of planning goes into just over two minutes of racing.
Déjà vu. Much like the prior years, the Tartan didn’t seem too interested with Buggy in 1949. So what we know is that 1949 seems very similar to 1948. Once again, 14 organizations (all 12 fraternities, Dorm Council and Citcom Clan) entered the race, and Prelims were run in 5 heats. The first 4 Heats had 3 buggies each, while the 5th Heat had only 2. Record-Breaking Year. There was little, if any, doubt that a course record would be broken this year. And in fact, each of DTD, PiKA, and KapSig,
The streets of the race course haven't changed, but the condition of the course varies due to potholes, which can make or break a fast run. The last course records were set in 2017, but this year potholes are making for some challenging conditions, said Amy Chen, a senior in psychology who has been driving for four years.

With the vehicles just inches from the ground, "even poorly filled potholes makes it dangerous to drive," she added.
