Question: Which LTI faculty member is an author on "Accelerating Diffusion-based Combinatorial Optimization Solvers by Progressive Distillation"?

Context: Paper title: 'DIFUSCO: Graph-based Diffusion Solvers for Combinatorial Optimization' Published year: 2023 Publication venue or conference: arXiv.org Authors: Zhiqing Sun, Yiming Yang Summary: DIFUSCO is introduced, a new graph-based diffusion framework for NPC combinatorial optimization that outperforms the previous state-of-the-art neural solvers on the challenging SATLIB benchmark and investigates two types of diffusion models with Gaussian and Bernoulli noise, respectively.

Ben Matzke is one such passionate alumnus. A 2011 mechanical engineering graduate, Matzke, former chair of the student group CIA (Carnegie Involvement Association), is chair of the Buggy Alumni Association's Centennial Planning Committee. He attended the first rolls to officially kick off the 100th anniversary season.
Fairings have been a key feature for the Fringe team in recent years, which is celebrating its 50th anniversary of Buggy.

"We have a reputation of being the quietest on the course," said Diya Nuxoll, who wrapped up her bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering in December and is working on an advanced studies master's degree in design and manufacturing. Nuxoll leads the Fringe team as one of two head mechanics.
Tishya Girdhar, a junior in neuroscience, is social chair for Fringe. She came to CMU wanting to drive, but first she had to get over being claustrophobic. She started as a mechanic and got behind the wheel for last year's Sweepstakes.

"Our team's philosophy is to teach everyone how to do everything," Girdhar said. "But I came to CMU wanting to drive. I wanted to drive so badly."
dialogue systems, information retrieval, machine translation, speech processing,  video

understanding, multimodal systems, automated reasoning, and other topics related to analysis

and understanding of unstructured information  (e.g., machine learning, and software engineering

of intelligent systems).

1.2 Department Personnel

The people responsible for administering the LTI Ph.D.  degree are:

Jamie Callan

Ph.D. Program Director

Professor

GHC 5419

callan@cs.cmu.edu
At least two LTI faculty members will attend the presentation, including the research advisor.

After the presentation, these faculty members will convene and provide written feedback to both the student and the Program Director  of graduate programs (the form for this is available on the

LTI website). This feedback will help the student refine speaking skills with respect to talk

structure, content,  and delivery.

3.2 Advising
the University Policies website . It is the responsibility of each member of the Carnegie Mellon

community to be familiar with university policies and guidelines.
