Question: What are the units for linguistics lab?

Context: Modern linguistics has arrived at the general assumption that the human mind/brain

applies a set of syntactic rules to recursively combine linguistic units into larger

objects, deriving an unbounded array of hierarchically structured expressions, with

humans inferring sentence meaning based on syntactic configuration (Chomsky,

1957; Everaert et al., 2015; Hagoort, 2023; Mukherji, 2022). Despite some recent

assembly-based representations of distinct features from these domains, as opposed

to single-unit encoding of a ‘lexical item’ and ‘word’. Stored linguistic knowledge can

involve the mapping from a semantic feature, to a syntactic feature, and to a

phonological feature, and this process is hypothesized to take place at the O level (see

below).

Emerging evidence for this framework comes from Dijksterhuis et al. (2022), in which

Buggy: Vehicle being raced and also a nickname for the competition.

Chute: A section of the freeroll portion of the buggy course (near the southwestern end of Frew Street at its intersection with Schenley Drive) where buggies make the sharp righthand turn from Schenley Drive onto Frew Street.

Chute Flagger: Team member who provides a signal for buggy drivers to know when to start the right-hand turn from Schenley Drive onto Frew Street.
In order to  complete the Master of Language Technologies degree, the student must pass 120

or more course units of senior- to-graduate courses, and meet the following criteria:

within those 120 units, at least 72 units of “LTI” courses and 24 units of “SCS” courses,

within those 72 units, 11 -711, 11- 791 (or an equivalent , see below ), and one ``Task

Orientation Focus'' class, and

within those 72 units, at least one of the following:

o an LTI lab course,

o 11-792, or
For a detailed breakdown of the above requirements, download and read the PhD Handbook. Curriculum: In order to obtain your Ph.D. in Language and Information Technologies, you need to pass 96 units (generally, eight courses) of graduate courses that fulfill these requirements: At least 72 units of LTI courses: Must include one class in each LTI focus area. At least 24 units of SCS courses. At least two lab courses in two different research areas. Here's a sample of what your five-year schedule
Curriculum: The Language Technologies Concentration requires that SCS students complete one core course and their choice of three elective courses of at least 9 units each. The electives can be chosen from a specific set of stand-alone courses. In addition to the four courses, students are required to do an undergraduate research project for at least 9 units to complete their concentration. Course Requirements for Undergraduate Minor
