Question: Where is the SENTECON paper published at?

Context: Paper title: 'SenteCon: Leveraging Lexicons to Learn Human-Interpretable Language Representations' Published year: 2023 Publication venue or conference: Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics Authors: Victoria Lin, Louis-Philippe Morency Summary: This work presents SenteCon, a method for introducing human interpretability in deep language representations that outperforms existing interpretable language representations with respect to both its downstream performance and
In this paper we introduced SENTECON, a human- interpretable language representation that captures sentence context while retaining the benefits of interpretable lexicons. We conducted human evalu- ations to determine the agreement between SENTE- CON representations and the actual content of the

2We use the term “sentence” for clarity, but our approach is also applicable to longer passages of text like paragraphs and documents, as our experiments show.

If you can ID any of the unknown buggies, let us know.

1949 – Design Competition (from the 1966 Buggy Book). Buggies are KapSig (far left), SAE’s design winner (#4, 2nd from the left), Men’s Dorms (#7, 3rd from the left), and DU (#11, far right).

1949 – SAE’s Design-winning buggy getting worked on (from the November 1949 issue of The Record, the SAE National Publication)

1949 – Citcom Clan Buggy (#9) (from the 1950 Thistle).
Delta Upsilon entered a three-wheeled buggy in 1940.

It’s quirky, it’s different, and it’s so Carnegie Mellon University, where the college experience is a little buggy.

Sweepstakes, better known as the Spring Carnival Buggy Races, will celebrate its 100th anniversary April 17-18, 2020. The CMU tradition is unlike any other.

9.3 Computers for MS Students

Students are expected to provide their own laptop computers that can be used to access
thesis defense. The pre sentation must communicate the research work done, similar to

a conference paper presentation. The committee will observe the presentation, and then decide whether the thesis and presentation were acceptable, or whether further

work is required. Unlike a P hD defense, only a simple majority vote of the committee is

required for approval.
The use of a photocopier or printer requires you to log in with your CMU ID card. LTI’s printers

are located in GHC 5404 and GHC 6604. The School of Computer Science provides a number of

black -and-white and color printers for use by students. The SCS Computer Facilities publishes a

list of printers online at http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~help/printing/.
