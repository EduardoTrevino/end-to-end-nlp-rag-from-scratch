Question: How many credits is the MIIS Capstone Planning Seminar worth?

Context: LLaMA-2 LLaMA-2 (Touvron et al., 2023b) consists of a series of base language models with a parameter count ranging from 7 billion to 70 billion. These base models are solely trained to opti- mize the likelihood of next-word prediction in the language modeling task. For a fair comparison, we employ the same prompt for LLaMA-2 as used for Dromedary-2.
The details of the training process are as follows. We started ﬁne-tuning the mT5, by mini- mizing the maximum-likelihood loss for 15 epochs, using a batch size of 8, accumulation steps of 4, and learning rate of 10e-5 with Adafactor optimization and cosine annealing learning rate decay schedule (Loshchilov and Hutter 2016). The maximum news length was set to 512 and max- imum summary length was determined as 120. We initialized our reinforcement learning models with the ﬁne-tuned models that

But a few of the specific rules changed slightly, or are worth noting again: All drivers, pushers, designers and builders were required to members of the organization they’re competing for All team members (including designers and builders) must be “eligible” under the Executive Board’s requirements, which include a minimum of 36 units and being in good academic standing (with a minimum GPA requirement). The buggy/driver combo must weigh a minimum of 180 pounds (up from the previous 160 lbs)
Today, it takes six people to maneuver the .84 -mile course around Schenley Park's Flagstaff Hill.

But while five pushers and a driver navigate the course's hills, dozens of people are needed to make a successful race happen. A year of planning goes into just over two minutes of racing.
This year Fringe is planning to roll four different vehicles, built and maintained in the Fringe workshop in the basement of the East Campus Garage, known as the "Froom."

"We're used to saying everything with 'fr' in front of it but when we say something in front of other people, it gets them confused," said Fringe head mechanic Dave Singh, who will graduate in May with a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering and biomedical engineering.
requirement. Participation is required unless waived in writing by the MIIS Program

Director.

3. Capstone requirements:  Students must complete a capstone project (36 units) and a

capstone planning seminar (6 units). The capstone requirement gives students

experience with collaborative, team -oriented software development; significant hands -

on experience with the techniques studied in the classroom; and an opportunity to work on a large software application.
a. The capstone project (36 units) is a large, group- oriented demonstration of

student skill in one or more areas covered by the degree. Typically,  the result of

the capstone project is a major software application. The capstone project is

supervised by a member of the faculty who meets with students on a weekly

basis to monitor progress and provide guidance. MIIS Graduate Student Handbook  Page 17

b. The capstone planning seminar (6 units) organizes students into groups; defines
Pass/fail grades are not permitted for courses used to satisfy a degree requirement, except for

the 11 -696 (A) Capstone Planning Seminar and 11 -935 (R) LTI Practicum that are a Pass/Fail. MIIS Graduate Student Handbook  Page 21

Graduate students who are required to take additional undergraduate courses to build up the

core foundations of computer science may not elect the pass/fail option for these courses.
