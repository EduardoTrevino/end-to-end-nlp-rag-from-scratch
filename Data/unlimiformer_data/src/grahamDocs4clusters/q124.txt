Question: In spring 2024, When do Mini-3 faculty course evaluations open?

Context: Sachan et al. (2022) evaluated their method using only QA (but not IR) datasets and their main results are for an impractically large three-billion parameter instruction-finetuned model, which was used essentially as a re-ranker (in a zero-shot scenario). The smallest model used by Sachan et al. (2022) had 250 million parameters (compared to our 30-million MiniLM model). It was evaluated only on the Natural Questions (NQ) collection (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019) where it outperformed BM25 by about

It showcases abilities akin to GPT4 but is computationally efficient. mPLUG-Owl (Ye et al., 2023) offers a new approach: initially aligning

Delta Upsilon entered a three-wheeled buggy in 1940.

It’s quirky, it’s different, and it’s so Carnegie Mellon University, where the college experience is a little buggy.

Sweepstakes, better known as the Spring Carnival Buggy Races, will celebrate its 100th anniversary April 17-18, 2020. The CMU tradition is unlike any other.

Buggy Races Keep Rolling at Carnegie Mellon

In its 99th year, the tradition is a Spring Carnival treat

By Heidi Opdyke

Sweepstakes, also known as the Buggy Races, has come a long way at Carnegie Mellon University. The slick, torpedo-like vessels carrying drivers with nerves of steel are a far cry from the two-man teams that once changed places halfway through a race and rode in everything from rain barrels with bicycle wheels to three-wheeled ash cans 99 years ago.
The streets of the race course haven't changed, but the condition of the course varies due to potholes, which can make or break a fast run. The last course records were set in 2017, but this year potholes are making for some challenging conditions, said Amy Chen, a senior in psychology who has been driving for four years.

With the vehicles just inches from the ground, "even poorly filled potholes makes it dangerous to drive," she added.
