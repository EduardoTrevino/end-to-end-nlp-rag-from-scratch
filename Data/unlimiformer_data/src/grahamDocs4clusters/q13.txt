Abstract
We introduce four phonetic word embedding methods—count-based, autoencoder, and metric and contrastive learning. Though some of these techniques are inspired by previous work, we are the first to apply them with supervision from articu- latory feature vectors, a seldom-exploited form of

1The technically correct term is phonological word embeddings but prior literature uses the term phonetic.

“Buggy doesn’t exist anywhere else. It’s a 100-year love of creation and collaboration,” said Olivia Keller at dawn on the inaugural morning practice — called first rolls — in late September. “That the alumni network can be so involved, that they continue to be passionate about buggy long after they’ve gone is very telling of how amazing and special buggy is. It’s part of the CMU experience,” said the senior chemical engineering major, pusher and chair of this year’s Kappa Kappa Gamma and Kappa
Delta Upsilon entered a three-wheeled buggy in 1940.

It’s quirky, it’s different, and it’s so Carnegie Mellon University, where the college experience is a little buggy.

Sweepstakes, better known as the Spring Carnival Buggy Races, will celebrate its 100th anniversary April 17-18, 2020. The CMU tradition is unlike any other.
Tishya Girdhar, a junior in neuroscience, is social chair for Fringe. She came to CMU wanting to drive, but first she had to get over being claustrophobic. She started as a mechanic and got behind the wheel for last year's Sweepstakes.

"Our team's philosophy is to teach everyone how to do everything," Girdhar said. "But I came to CMU wanting to drive. I wanted to drive so badly."
5. Emoticons, 1982 Sure, it was just a joke, but (for better or worse) it’s endured for more than three decades. CMU researcher Scott Fahlman created the emoticon to clear up misunderstandings on computer message boards. We’ve been looking at the world sideways ever since. :-)
