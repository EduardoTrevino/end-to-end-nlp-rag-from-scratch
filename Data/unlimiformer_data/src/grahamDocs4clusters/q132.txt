Question: In the Plan, Eliminate and Track paper, which benchmark was used in the experiments?

Context: We propose the Plan, Eliminate, and Track (PET) framework. The Plan module trans- lates a task description into a list of high-level sub-tasks. The Eliminate module masks out irrelevant objects and receptacles from the ob- servation for the current sub-task. Finally, the Track module determines whether the agent has accomplished each sub-task. On the Alf- World instruction following benchmark, the PET framework leads to a signiﬁcant 15% improvement over SOTA for generalization to human goal

Salakhutdinov, Tom M. Mitchell, Yue Wu, Yonatan Bisk, A. Azaria, Yuan-Fang Li Summary: A framework to use the knowledge in LLMs to simplify the control problem, rather than solving it is proposed, which leads to a significant 15% improvement over SOTA for generalization to human goal
Dataset The base training dataset for the experiments in this paper contains 268 GB of Python, Java and JavaScript ﬁles from The Stack v1.1 (Kocetkov et al., 2022) after removing data from opt- out requests, near-deduplication, PII-redaction (see Section 4), and ﬁltering based on line-length and percentage of alphanumeric characters. This dataset was also decontaminated by removing ﬁles that contained test-samples from the following benchmarks: HumanEval (Chen et al., 2021), APPS (Hendrycks et

front hills, causing more congestion for spectators on those hills. A police tow truck was present, but it was not permitted to clear the street. Up the front hills, DTD was in the lead, followed by PiKA and KapSig. DTD went into the freerolls first, but the drama was behind them. As PiKA entered the freeroll, PiKA’s buggy crowded KapSig’s buggy and forced KapSig wide, causing KapSig to swerve and hit at least 1 spectator (the Tartan says that KapSig “got out pencil and paper to try to figure

After the controversy of 1947 (which, sadly and as noted above, we don’t have details of), Sweepstakes decided to tighten up the rules to avoid any confusion for Raceday. Of course, we don’t have the rules that were tightened either. We’ll keep digging, and if we find it out, we’ll update this post. On the plus side, 1948 didn’t appear to have any controversies.

It laid the groundwork for a research institution, recruiting leading scientists, offering sponsored fellowships with government and industry leaders and pioneering nontraditional interdisciplinary research, which brought together physicists, chemists and metallurgists, for example. Interdisciplinary research would become the hallmark of Carnegie Mellon research. It initiated the 'Carnegie Plan' in 1938, a new curriculum that required science and

a conference paper presentation. The committee will observe the presentation, and then decide whether the thesis and presentation were acceptable, or whether further

work is required. Unlike a P hD defense, only a simple majority vote of the committee is

required for approval.
