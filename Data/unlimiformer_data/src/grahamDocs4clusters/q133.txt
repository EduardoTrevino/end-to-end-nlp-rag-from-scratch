Any internship must be planned in consultation with the student’s advisor and the LTI Ph.D.

Coordinator. If an internship is part of a fully -funded external fellowship (e.g., Microsoft Research

Fellowship), the student does not need prior LTI approval, but should still coordinate with their

advisor. International students must consult with Office of International Education (OIE) for eligibility before seeking an internship or signing an offer contract.
Offices are assigned by the LTI’s Office Manager (see Section 1.2 , Department Personnel, for

contact information).
