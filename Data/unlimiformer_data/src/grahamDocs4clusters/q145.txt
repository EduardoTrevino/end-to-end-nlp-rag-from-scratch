ToMi Adjustments (ToMi’) ToMi stories are in question-answering format. We randomly sam- pled 30 stories (each story has 6 questions, 180 questions in total) from the ToMi dataset and mod- ified them to match a sentence completion format with the same meaning.5 For example the question: “Where does Oliver think that Emma searches for the grapes?”. Was adjusted to the following sen- tence completion task: “Oliver thinks that Emma searches for the grapes in the”.

The streets of the race course haven't changed, but the condition of the course varies due to potholes, which can make or break a fast run. The last course records were set in 2017, but this year potholes are making for some challenging conditions, said Amy Chen, a senior in psychology who has been driving for four years.

With the vehicles just inches from the ground, "even poorly filled potholes makes it dangerous to drive," she added.
Safety is a top priority for teams. All drivers are required to have five pieces of safety gear: mouth guard, goggles, a harness that includes three points of contact to the body of the buggy, gloves and a helmet. And during practice runs and races, flaggers man the course to let drivers know if it's safe to proceed.
Déjà vu. Much like the prior years, the Tartan didn’t seem too interested with Buggy in 1949. So what we know is that 1949 seems very similar to 1948. Once again, 14 organizations (all 12 fraternities, Dorm Council and Citcom Clan) entered the race, and Prelims were run in 5 heats. The first 4 Heats had 3 buggies each, while the 5th Heat had only 2. Record-Breaking Year. There was little, if any, doubt that a course record would be broken this year. And in fact, each of DTD, PiKA, and KapSig,

counts as one- half of an LTI course. Unless otherwise specified, "course" means an actual

any one MLD (10 -XXX) graduate course to count as an "LTI course".

4.4 Definitions of LTI Terminology

We define here some of the terms as used in this handbook:

An “LTI course” is any 12 -unit course with a number of 11 -XXX; a 6 -unit course with an

11-XXX counts as 1/2 of an LTI course. Unless otherwise specified, "course" means an

actual classroom course, not  credit given for research or independent study. Note that

we will allow any one MLD (10 -xxx) graduate- level course to count as an “LTI course.”
