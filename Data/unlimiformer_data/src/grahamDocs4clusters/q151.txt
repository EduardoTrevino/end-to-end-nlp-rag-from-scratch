Question: What are the two key factors addressed by CSurF?

Context: Paper title: 'CSurF: Sparse Lexical Retrieval through Contextualized Surface Forms' Published year: 2023 Publication venue or conference: International Conference on the Theory of Information Retrieval Authors: Zhen Fan, Jamie Callan, Luyu Gao Summary: This paper proposes to directly bridge the surface form space and the term semantics space in lexical exact-match retrieval via contextualized surface forms (CSF), reaching comparable accuracy as lexical all-to-all soft match systems as an
framing the relation between units and coherence. LFP coherence appears to be

determined by two factors (Schneider et al., 2021): (i) coherence due to the direct

contribution of afferent synaptic inputs; (ii) coherence between the sender LFP and

the summed population spiking activity in the receiver. Coherence therefore depends

on connectivity strength and oscillation power, and does not need purely oscillatory

coupling or spike-phase locking in a receiver.
Participants were also asked to rate which considerations they applied when choosing material. Appropriateness of content and availability through the library were the two most important considerations, with price, simultaneous access and ease of access for students showing as lower considerations.

Fairings have been a key feature for the Fringe team in recent years, which is celebrating its 50th anniversary of Buggy.

"We have a reputation of being the quietest on the course," said Diya Nuxoll, who wrapped up her bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering in December and is working on an advanced studies master's degree in design and manufacturing. Nuxoll leads the Fringe team as one of two head mechanics.
According to the CIT Alumnus from May, the finals were “undecided”, and per the 1948 Thistle, the race ended in protest. But whatever happened seemed to be between PiKA and DU, because the two of them were granted a reroll to determine the winner. And in that reroll, DU’s “Flying Pork Barrel” buggy, with cowboy hat-wearing driver, crossed the finish line first, earning the victory. DTD apparently came in 3rd, finishing in a time of 3:00. If you know anything about this protest (or anything else
“Buggy is a sport that encompasses all elements that CMU has to offer,” he said. “Everything that goes into it, the challenge, the teamwork, the fun, the rewards. It’s a real-life challenge working with a team. I learned to work together with people with different personalities and visions toward the same goal to make it happen.”
