Question: What is the name of the proposed approach for fairness domain adaptation in semantic scene segmentation?

Context: In this work, we proposed a multi-modal regularisa- tion scheme for self-training approaches in unsupervised domain adaptation for semantic segmentation. We de- rive an objectness constraint from multi-modal clustering that is then used to formulate a contrastive objective for regularisation. We show that this regularisation consis- tently improves upon different types of self-training meth- ods and even achieves state-of-the-art performance in popu- lar benchmarks. In the future, we plan to

Fairings have been a key feature for the Fringe team in recent years, which is celebrating its 50th anniversary of Buggy.

"We have a reputation of being the quietest on the course," said Diya Nuxoll, who wrapped up her bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering in December and is working on an advanced studies master's degree in design and manufacturing. Nuxoll leads the Fringe team as one of two head mechanics.
Transition: Procedure whereby one pusher finishes pushing a buggy and the next pusher in sequence starts to push that same buggy.
You'll know it's a tartan if... • "It's a check or pattern in a variety of colours in woven fabric in which bands of colour are repeated in equal proportion in warp (running lengthwise) and weft (running across)." • "Each stripe of the warp crosses every stripe of the weft, so when vertical and horizontal stripes of the same color cross, the result is solid color at the point of intersection." • "The arrangement of colored threads is the same in the warp as in the weft."
