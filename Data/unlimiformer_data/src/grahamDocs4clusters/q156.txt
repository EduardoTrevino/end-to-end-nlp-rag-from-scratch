Question: How much does it cost to apply for the MLT program if an application is submitted on December 4th, 2023?

Context: receive 6 scores, and we use the average score as the final score for each response. The response with the higher final score is considered the better response. The GPT-4 evaluation incurred a cost of $20.45 for InstructBlip and $20.90 for MiniGPT-4.

Table 11: Template used to query GPT-4 for evaluating the response quality of different models.
Taking an estimate of 500 tokens per generation, the cost of querying OpenAI GPT-3 Curie API can be up to $100 for Robust04 and TREC-COVID. Assuming that sampling from the 137-B FLAN model (used by (Dai et al., 2022)) to be as expensive as from the largest GPT-3 model Davinci (which has a similar number of parameters), each generation in the Promptagator study (Dai et al., 2022), was 10x more expensive compared to InPars study (Bonifacio et al., 2022). Moreover, because Dai et al. (2022)

The Finals, initially scheduled for 2pm on Saturday, May 4, were ultimately postponed until Saturday, May 11, due to a downpour that cast a damper on an otherwise exciting Spring Carnival. Controversial Finals. An overcast sky threatened rain on the makeup date as well, though it held off long enough for the race to be run. But some of the spectators may have wished the rain came sooner. Although signs were posted about the makeup date, cars ignored the notices and ended up blocking part of the
