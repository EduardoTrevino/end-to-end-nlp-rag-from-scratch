Question: What is the proposed learning objective to improve perceptual quality of speech?

Context: This paper makes the following contributions:

1. We propose a new evaluation method for TTS that captures distributional similarity between real and synthetic speech as a proxy for perceptual speech quality tests.

2. We compare the proposed metric to multiple automatic metrics and Mean Opinion Score (MOS), and show that our metric correlates well with human-provided MOS.

we have used a mixed training objective to optimize a speciﬁc measure with reinforcement training objective Lrl as well as to increase quality and readability of the output with maximum-likelihood training objective Lml.

4. Experiments and quantitative results We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed similarity measures and abstractive summariza- tion model, along with the pre-trained language models and datasets used in our experimental framework.
