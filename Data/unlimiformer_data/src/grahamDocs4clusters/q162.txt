Question: What types of information does FiT5 integrate into a single unified model?

Context: Common IR pipelines are typically cascade sys- tems that may involve multiple rankers and/or fusion models to integrate different informa- tion step-by-step. In this paper, we propose a novel re-ranker named Fusion-in-T5 (FiT5), which integrates document text information, retrieval features, and global document in- formation into a single unified model using templated-based input and global attention. Ex- periments on passage ranking benchmarks MS MARCO and TREC DL show that FiT5 sig-
In this paper, we introduce Fusion-in-T5 (FiT5), a T5-based (Raffel et al., 2020) re-ranking model that collects ranking signals and ranks documents within a unified framework. FiT5 is designed to consolidate multiple IR features, including doc- ument texts, ranking features, and global docu- ment information, into a single learnable model. Specifically, the input to FiT5 is formulated us- ing a template that incorporates the document text with the ranking feature, which is represented as
The results of passage ranking on MS MARCO and TREC DL are presented in Table 1. By incorpo- rating multiple types of ranking information, FiT5 greatly improves over the first-stage retrieval model coCondenser, and outperforms typical BERT Re- ranker and monoT5 that re-rank on top of the same retriever. On MS MARCO, FiT5 further outper- forms three-stage ranking pipelines HLATR-large and Expando-Mono-Duo, which uses significantly larger models (RoBERTa-large (Liu et al., 2019) / 2×T5-3B) and

Drivers, have the closest connection to the vehicles, aside from the mechanics who spent countless hours building and maintaining individual buggies. While races are brief, each driver must log a number of practice runs to qualify to race. Teams practice nights and weekends throughout the fall and spring semesters as weather permits. Buggies are often built around drivers, so the fit can be snug, and drivers are often less than 5 feet, 3 inches in height. Most — but not all — are women.
But a few of the specific rules changed slightly, or are worth noting again: All drivers, pushers, designers and builders were required to members of the organization they’re competing for All team members (including designers and builders) must be “eligible” under the Executive Board’s requirements, which include a minimum of 36 units and being in good academic standing (with a minimum GPA requirement). The buggy/driver combo must weigh a minimum of 180 pounds (up from the previous 160 lbs)
We don’t have many details of the race itself, but DTD took the win, just barely edging out KapSig, who was less than 1 second behind. DTD’s goggled driver was Dick Stanley, and the Hill 5 pusher working very hard was Barry Rowles. As a consolation prize, KapSig’s streamlined aluminum buggy (which looks just like a slightly larger version of today’s designs, with an extra wheel) took home the Design Comp trophy.
