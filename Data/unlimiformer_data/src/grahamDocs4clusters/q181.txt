Question: What are the results of training 1.1B parameter models on Java, JavaScript, and Python subsets of The Stack and evaluating them on MultiPL-E?

Context: In this tech report, we summarize the learnings of the BigCode community in developing the Santa models, a set of 1.1B-parameter models trained on the Java, JavaScript, and Python subsets of The Stack and evaluated on MultiPL-E (Cassano et al., 2022). We describe the ﬁrst steps of the commu- nity towards developing larger code models and report experiments to de-risk the model architecture and the data processing pipeline. Speciﬁcally, the contributions of this report can be summarized as
Using the ﬁndings from these experiments, we train a ﬁnal 1.1B parameter model, dubbed SantaCoder, on Python, JavaScript, and Java. This model obtains comparable or stronger performance than previous open-source multilingual models, InCoder-6.7B and CodeGen- Multi-2.7B, on code generation and inﬁlling tasks on the MultiPL-E benchmark for these three languages, despite being substantially smaller.

the Java, JavaScript, and Python subsets of The Stack (Kocetkov et al., 2022) and evaluate them on the MultiPL-E text-to-code benchmark (Cas- sano et al., 2022). We ﬁnd that more aggressive ﬁltering of near-duplicates can further boost performance and, surprisingly, that selecting ﬁles from repositories with 5+ GitHub stars deteriorates performance signiﬁcantly. Our best model out- performs previous open-source multilingual code generation models (InCoder- 6.7B and CodeGen-Multi-2.7B) in both

1946 – PiKA’s Buggy (from the 1947 Thistle). It didn’t win Design Competition, but it had the best aesthetic design. Prelim Heats and Results. The Prelims were run in 3 heats, with 3 teams in each. The rules initially stated that the winner of each heat would compete in the finals, but it seems that the rules changed to be the three fastest times instead, as the Prelim results printed in the May 7, 1946 Tartan indicate that the Finals was just a rematch of Prelim Heat 1. According to the May 7
Tartan, Heat 1 saw a very tight race between KapSig, DTD, and PiKA, with KapSig winning in 3:24.5, DTD finishing in 3:25.1, and PiKA finishing in 3:26.3. Those were the top 3 times and they advanced to the finals. Prelim Heat 2 paired Beta, SAE, and DU, and SAE won the heat by default, as Beta was DQ’d for a pushbar violation and DU was DQ’d for a Hill 4-5 transition violation (the Tartan reports that they “shoved the buggy into the last zone instead of pushing it”). Prelims Heat 3 was a battle
But a few of the specific rules changed slightly, or are worth noting again: All drivers, pushers, designers and builders were required to members of the organization they’re competing for All team members (including designers and builders) must be “eligible” under the Executive Board’s requirements, which include a minimum of 36 units and being in good academic standing (with a minimum GPA requirement). The buggy/driver combo must weigh a minimum of 180 pounds (up from the previous 160 lbs)
