where Lf t/Lf t are finetuning/pretraining loss functions, Df t/Dpt are finetuning/pretraining datasets, and w(·; λ) is the data reweighting network. Following the experiment setup in TARTAN [11], we use task-specific data and a masked language modeling loss in our auxiliary task and perform experiments with RoBERTa-base on 4 datasets from the original DAPT/TAPT paper. We compare our SAMA- based data optimization against DAPT and TARTAN-MT. We exclude TAPT and TARTAN-Meta respectively because
At this point, the project group arranged to embed links to the toolkit in each institution’s web pages and to actively promote the resource at every available opportunity. The toolkit had a ‘soft’ launch in September 2022 at an OpenFest event run by Sheffield, before being formally launched during Open Access Week in October 2022 at an event led by the University of Leeds.
