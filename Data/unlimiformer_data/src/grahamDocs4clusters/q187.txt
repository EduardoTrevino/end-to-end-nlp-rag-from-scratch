Question: In the paper "Modeling Empathic Similarity in Personal Narratives", what is the name of the dataset created for this task?

Figure 2: Spearman (upper left) and Pearson (lower right) correlations between performance on suite tasks. All models from Table 1 are used.

Surprisingly, the best model for human similarity is a simple count-based model. Semantic word embeddings perform worse than explicit phonetic embeddings, most notably on human similarity and analogies. However, they do perform reasonably on cognate detection.
Inspired by Fourrier (2022), we probe our model for diachronic information on how genetically re- lated each Romance language is to each other. We create a distance matrix between every pair of lan- guages in a dataset by taking the cosine similarity between a pair’s language embeddings. We then use sklearn (Pedregosa et al., 2011)’s implementa- tion of the Ward variance minimization algorithm (Ward Jr, 1963) to perform hierarchical clustering on the distance matrix. We take a consensus of the

Scotty's road from popular icon to official mascot of the university began in 2006. Carnegie Mellon formed a Mascot Identity Task Force in November 2006, which consisted of students, faculty, staff and alumni. The Task Force was co-chaired by Director of Athletics Susan Bassett and Dean of Student Affairs Jennifer Church.
Déjà vu. Much like the prior years, the Tartan didn’t seem too interested with Buggy in 1949. So what we know is that 1949 seems very similar to 1948. Once again, 14 organizations (all 12 fraternities, Dorm Council and Citcom Clan) entered the race, and Prelims were run in 5 heats. The first 4 Heats had 3 buggies each, while the 5th Heat had only 2. Record-Breaking Year. There was little, if any, doubt that a course record would be broken this year. And in fact, each of DTD, PiKA, and KapSig,
In the spring, the Task Force partnered with SME Branding — a firm with more than 17 years of experience creating mascots for professional sports teams and universities — to develop the graphics for the mascot. During October, students and alumni reviewed potential mascot images in focus groups.
