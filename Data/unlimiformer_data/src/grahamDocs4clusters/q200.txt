3.2 Ranking Regimes Here, we distinguish between two LTR regimes: (i) tabular search for head queries; and (ii) general LTR model for tail queries. Note that the majority of previous studies focused only on the general LTR regime [e.g., 35, 44], or the tabular regime [e.g., 6, 43]. In contrast, we follow [49] and consider both LTR regimes.
