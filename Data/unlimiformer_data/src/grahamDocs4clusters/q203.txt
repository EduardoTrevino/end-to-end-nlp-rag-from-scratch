Fusion-in-T5: Unifying Document Ranking Signals for Improved Information Retrieval
In this paper, we propose Fusion-in-T5 (FiT5), which collects and unifies IR features on the re- ranking stage. We conduct experiments on MS MARCO and TREC DL, demonstrating FiT5’s ad- vantage in effectiveness. In addition, we provide an analytical demonstration to show the rationale of the effectiveness of FiT5 in incorporating global document information and ranking features.

Ben Matzke is one such passionate alumnus. A 2011 mechanical engineering graduate, Matzke, former chair of the student group CIA (Carnegie Involvement Association), is chair of the Buggy Alumni Association's Centennial Planning Committee. He attended the first rolls to officially kick off the 100th anniversary season.

For the second year in a row, we had another controversial Finals involving PiKA (but thanks to limited info in the Tartan, we’re missing some juicy details). But this time it earned one fraternity, with their unique buggy/driver combo, their first and only winning trophy.
