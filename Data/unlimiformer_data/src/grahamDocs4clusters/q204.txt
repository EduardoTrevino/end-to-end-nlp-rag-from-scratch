Question: What pre-trained model does MOSAIC leverage knowledge from?

Context: unified multi-sensory object property representations. While it is undeniable that visual information plays a prominent role, we acknowledge that many fundamental object properties extend beyond the visual domain to encompass attributes like texture, mass distribution, or sounds, which significantly influence how we interact with objects. In MOSAIC, we leverage this profound insight by distilling knowledge from the extensive pre-trained Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model,
data obtained through robotic object exploration. MOSAIC accomplishes this by distilling knowledge from the extensive pre-trained CLIP text model. To test our learned unified representations, we rely on a dataset where a robot engages with 100 objects, executing 10 exploratory behaviors while recording multiple sensory signals. The robot tackles two tasks reliant on perceiving object properties: object catego- rization and the fetch object task. The results highlight the ef- ficiency of our
Fig. 1: Overview of the MOSAIC Framework: Initially, the robot collects sensory data through object exploration, which is then used to train models for distilling unified multimodal representations guided by a pre-trained text encoder. These acquired representations are subsequently applied to a variety of downstream tasks.

seen it yet! And On New Roads! This is the first record we have of the roads being paved! 2 weeks before Raceday, the City of Pittsburgh re-paved the Buggy course, allowing the buggies to race on fresh roadways. Pittsburgh Police were also out in full force on Raceday to assist with course control…Though as you’ll see, this was probably only during the Prelims. New Rules in Place. The April 9, 1946 Tartan printed the 12 rules for Buggy, our first look at the rules in several years. A lot of the
Since the first Campus Week in 1920, when “chariots” were built to race around campus, student groups have been working year-round, using their engineering skills, design expertise and penchant for interdisciplinary collaboration to secretly build, modify and refine the most aerodynamic, torpedo-like vessel they call a “buggy.”
