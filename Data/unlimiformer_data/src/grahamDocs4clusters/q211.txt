Eq. (2) encapsulates the recurrence relation of the S4 models (Gu et al., 2022; Gupta et al., 2022), S5 model (Smith et al., 2023), and Linear Recurrent Unit (Orvieto et al., 2023). For example, A is in the family of HiPPO matrix (Gu et al., 2023) in S4 or a complex diagonal matrix in Linear Recurrent Unit. We show in Proposition 1 that such input- independent A matrix cannot represent subtraction.

Proposition 1. An input-independent LRNN is in- consistent in representing subtraction.

First Non-Greek Orgs. 14 Organizations were entered for Raceday in 1948. They included all 12 fraternities (ATO, Beta, Beta Sigma Rho, DTD, DU, KapSig, PhiKap, PiKA, SAE, SigNu, Tau Delta Phi, and Theta Xi), the Men’s Dorms, and Citcom Clan (the commuters – “Citcom” is short for “CIT Commuter”). Although the Men’s Dorms were permitted to enter as far back as 1928, this is the first year that we have evidence that any organization other than a Greek actually did so. Training started in April,
