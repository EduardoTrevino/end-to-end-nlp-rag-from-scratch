Question: In summer 2024, When do Semester & Mini-6 Faculty Course Evaluations open?

Context: Sachan et al. (2022) evaluated their method using only QA (but not IR) datasets and their main results are for an impractically large three-billion parameter instruction-finetuned model, which was used essentially as a re-ranker (in a zero-shot scenario). The smallest model used by Sachan et al. (2022) had 250 million parameters (compared to our 30-million MiniLM model). It was evaluated only on the Natural Questions (NQ) collection (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019) where it outperformed BM25 by about

Déjà vu. Much like the prior years, the Tartan didn’t seem too interested with Buggy in 1949. So what we know is that 1949 seems very similar to 1948. Once again, 14 organizations (all 12 fraternities, Dorm Council and Citcom Clan) entered the race, and Prelims were run in 5 heats. The first 4 Heats had 3 buggies each, while the 5th Heat had only 2. Record-Breaking Year. There was little, if any, doubt that a course record would be broken this year. And in fact, each of DTD, PiKA, and KapSig,
Depending on Friday and Saturday's conditions, most heats may run just two lanes instead of three. But still, despite some of the challenges, Chen said she wouldn't miss it.

"Being a driver is really fun," Chen said. "I love going fast and going around the course."
The streets of the race course haven't changed, but the condition of the course varies due to potholes, which can make or break a fast run. The last course records were set in 2017, but this year potholes are making for some challenging conditions, said Amy Chen, a senior in psychology who has been driving for four years.

With the vehicles just inches from the ground, "even poorly filled potholes makes it dangerous to drive," she added.
