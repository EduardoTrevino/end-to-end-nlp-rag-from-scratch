Question: What was the conclusion of the study regarding the effectiveness of query rewriting techniques using large language models for multilingual, document-grounded question-answering systems?

Context: Paper title: 'Language-Agnostic Transformers and Assessing ChatGPT-Based Query Rewriting for Multilingual Document-Grounded QA' Published year: 2023 Publication venue or conference: Workshop on Document-grounded Dialogue and Conversational Question Answering Authors: T. Mitamura, Srijan Bansal, Mitali Potnis, Soham Dinesh Tiwari, Srinivas Gowriraj, Eric Nyberg Summary: This paper assesses the effectiveness of both language-agnostic and language-aware paradigms for multilingual pre-trained
We have categorized several techniques for making effective use of large language models, as summarized in Table 1. These techniques include strategies to improve instruction quality, use of reference text, task decomposition, promoting the model’s “thinking” process, integrating external

5 Conclusion

In this paper, we present M3IT, a multi-modal multilingual instruction tuning dataset for aiding the development of multi-modal large language models. The dataset comprises 2.4 million carefully curated instances and 400 manually written task instructions across 40 tasks. We build Ying-VLM to validate the effectiveness of our dataset. Quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate that the

Since the first Campus Week in 1920, when “chariots” were built to race around campus, student groups have been working year-round, using their engineering skills, design expertise and penchant for interdisciplinary collaboration to secretly build, modify and refine the most aerodynamic, torpedo-like vessel they call a “buggy.”
and the organizations snuck out at midnight to get some practice on the course. Avoiding Controversies. After the controversy of 1947 (which, sadly and as noted above, we don’t have details of), Sweepstakes decided to tighten up the rules to avoid any confusion for Raceday. Of course, we don’t have the rules that were tightened either. We’ll keep digging, and if we find it out, we’ll update this post. On the plus side, 1948 didn’t appear to have any controversies.

First “Broadcast”. 1948 is the first indication that we have of a “broadcast” on Raceday. According to the May 18, 1948 Tartan, a jeep patrolled the course and carried both the starter and a PA system, allowing the occupants of the vehicle to broadcast the race to the spectators on the course (as long as you were in range to hear the PA
