Question: What is the benefit of FLARE over existing retrieval augmented LMs?

Context: to retrieve, it is important to consider what LMs intend to gen- erate in the future, as the goal of active retrieval is to benefit future generations. Therefore, we propose anticipating the future by generating a temporary next sentence, using it as a query to retrieve rel- evant documents, and then regenerating the next sentence conditioning on the retrieved documents. Combining the two aspects, we propose Forward- Looking Active REtrieval augmented generation (FLARE), as illustrated in
Our intuition is that (1) LMs should only retrieve information when they do not have the necessary knowledge to avoid unnecessary or inappropriate retrieval, and (2) the retrieval queries should reflect the intents of future generations. We propose two forward-looking active retrieval augmented gener- ation (FLARE) methods to implement the active retrieval augmented generation framework. The first method prompts the LM to generate retrieval queries when necessary while generating the an- swer
tioned in Krishna et al. (2021) such as difficulties of grounding generation in retrieval and evalua- tion, both single-time retrieval and FLARE did not provide significant gains over not using retrieval. From an engineering perspective, interleaving gen- eration and retrieval with a naive implementation increases both overheads and the cost of generation. LMs need to be activated multiple times (once for each retrieval) and a caching-free implementation also requires recomputing the previous

Fairings have been a key feature for the Fringe team in recent years, which is celebrating its 50th anniversary of Buggy.

"We have a reputation of being the quietest on the course," said Diya Nuxoll, who wrapped up her bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering in December and is working on an advanced studies master's degree in design and manufacturing. Nuxoll leads the Fringe team as one of two head mechanics.
This year Fringe is planning to roll four different vehicles, built and maintained in the Fringe workshop in the basement of the East Campus Garage, known as the "Froom."

"We're used to saying everything with 'fr' in front of it but when we say something in front of other people, it gets them confused," said Fringe head mechanic Dave Singh, who will graduate in May with a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering and biomedical engineering.
