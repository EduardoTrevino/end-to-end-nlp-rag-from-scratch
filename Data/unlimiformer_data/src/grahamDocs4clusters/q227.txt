Question: What is the MOS-Q achieved by the MQTTS quantizer with a code size of 1024, on the VoxCeleb test set?

Context: Speaker Similarity Score (SSS). In multi-speaker TTS, it is also important to evaluate how well the synthesizer transfers speaker characteristics. Here we use the cosine

MQTTS Quant.
5.1 Quantizer Analysis Table 1 shows the reconstruction quality of the quantizer. From RCER, it is clear that using a single codebook (N = 1) drastically distorts the input phone sequence. Their distinc- tive low MOS-Q and MOS-N scores also suggest that N = 1 is not sufﬁcient to generate high-quality and natural speech. Even if we span a much larger codebook size, 65536, there is almost no difference compared to the 1024 codes across all metrics. This result indicates the necessity of having
speech quality (MOS-Q). For the remain- der of our experiments, we use N = 4 with a 160 code size, as we observe little perceptible quality and intelligibility dif- ference when we increase from N = 4 to 8.

Title: Neural Code Generation:
Beta’s new design was the winner of the first post-war Design Competition. The buggy, designed by Rick Saxton, was shaped like a bug with welded tubular steel. The real design battle seemed to be between Beta and PiKA, and the Tartan noted that PiKA’s buggy had a better appearance. However, Beta’s was structurally superior and that allowed it to take home the design trophy.
the 3 teams qualifying for Finals, broke the post-war record. In the finals, it was another close battle, with DTD squeaking it out over PiKA. DTD’s winning time of 2:42.5 was fast enough to set the course record, and PiKA’s 2:43.5 was only ½ second behind the prior record. SAE’s Best Design. SAE took home the trophy for Design Comp with their sleek aluminum buggy. Unfortunately, we haven’t found a photo. [Ed. Update: Based on the buggies from 1950, the 1950 Thistle’s actual description of
After an hour-long argument with the judges (and presumably the Sweepstakes committee), the decision to DQ PiKA was upheld and DTD was awarded the victory. Final Time. The Tartan reported that DTD’s winning time was 3:49, but our database has the time as 2:49. 3:49 would be significantly slower than any other race on this course, but I also think it’s possible. Bleak skies threatened the race (meaning it may have been bad weather), the best Prelim time was 3:24.5, and DTD was the 2nd buggy to
