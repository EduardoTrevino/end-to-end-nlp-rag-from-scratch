Question: What loss functions are proposed in the Fairness Continual Learning approach?

Context: Furthermore, through the optimization of the loss function, we observe a further 3.7% increase in detection accuracy while maintaining consistent detection speed. This underlines the success of the proposed loss function in prioritizing high-score prediction bounding boxes and diminishing the inﬂuence of redundant bounding boxes during subsequent screening.

2019) to prevent the model from becoming overly conﬁ- dent. In this work, we propose a loss function with soft labeling that connects contrastive learning and entropy regularization (Grandvalet and Bengio, 2004).
where λ (respectively, θ) are the parameters of meta (base) learners, Dmeta (Dbase) are meta (base) datasets, and Lmeta (Lbase) are meta (base) loss functions. An important implication of the above formulation is that meta learning changes the task of finding the optimal inductive biases from designing heuristics to designing meta optimization problems. As an example, consider the problem of finding the optimal inductive bias for fair classification given class-imbalanced training data. A
