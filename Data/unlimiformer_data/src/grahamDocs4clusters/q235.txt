Question: What is the name of the method introduced in "Semantic Pyramid AutoEncoder for Multimodal Generation"?

Context: Paper title: 'SPAE: Semantic Pyramid AutoEncoder for Multimodal Generation with Frozen LLMs' Published year: 2023 Publication venue or conference: arXiv.org Authors: Lu Jiang, Wolfgang Macherey, A. Hauptmann, David A. Ross, Irfan Essa, K. Murphy, Vivek Kumar, Ming Yang, Yonatan Bisk, Yong Cheng, Lijun Yu, Zhiruo Wang, Yanping Huang Summary: This method marks the first successful attempt to enable a frozen LLM to generate image content while surpassing state-of-the-art performance in image
proposed a deep learning based approach to repair fa¸cade defect textures from easily accessible semantic label map. Speciﬁcally, we proposed a semantics recovery method by using image completion algorithm to improve automation of de-occlusion. A regularity-aware multi-domain universal image translation method is used to synthesize building fa¸cade textures of arbitrary styles. This method achieves better results by enriching the details and improving the regularity of synthesized images.
The two main architectures that are ﬁne-tuned to predict sentence pair scoring tasks are cross- encoders and bi-encoders, illustrated in Fig. 1. In the cross-encoder approach, two sentences are passed simultaneously to the transformer network, which directly computes their semantic sim- ilarity score between 0 and 1. We used the cross-encoder architecture described by Reimers and Gurevych (2019), which is trained with the binary cross-entropy loss:

BCE = (y log (ˆy) + (1 − y) log (1 − ˆy))

Transition: Procedure whereby one pusher finishes pushing a buggy and the next pusher in sequence starts to push that same buggy.
1946 – PiKA’s Buggy (from the 1947 Thistle). It didn’t win Design Competition, but it had the best aesthetic design. Prelim Heats and Results. The Prelims were run in 3 heats, with 3 teams in each. The rules initially stated that the winner of each heat would compete in the finals, but it seems that the rules changed to be the three fastest times instead, as the Prelim results printed in the May 7, 1946 Tartan indicate that the Finals was just a rematch of Prelim Heat 1. According to the May 7
Delta Upsilon entered a three-wheeled buggy in 1940.

It’s quirky, it’s different, and it’s so Carnegie Mellon University, where the college experience is a little buggy.

Sweepstakes, better known as the Spring Carnival Buggy Races, will celebrate its 100th anniversary April 17-18, 2020. The CMU tradition is unlike any other.
