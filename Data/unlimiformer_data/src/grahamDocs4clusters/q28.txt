The streets of the race course haven't changed, but the condition of the course varies due to potholes, which can make or break a fast run. The last course records were set in 2017, but this year potholes are making for some challenging conditions, said Amy Chen, a senior in psychology who has been driving for four years.

With the vehicles just inches from the ground, "even poorly filled potholes makes it dangerous to drive," she added.
Today, it takes six people to maneuver the .84 -mile course around Schenley Park's Flagstaff Hill.

But while five pushers and a driver navigate the course's hills, dozens of people are needed to make a successful race happen. A year of planning goes into just over two minutes of racing.
