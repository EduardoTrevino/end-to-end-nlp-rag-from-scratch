The Finals, initially scheduled for 2pm on Saturday, May 4, were ultimately postponed until Saturday, May 11, due to a downpour that cast a damper on an otherwise exciting Spring Carnival. Controversial Finals. An overcast sky threatened rain on the makeup date as well, though it held off long enough for the race to be run. But some of the spectators may have wished the rain came sooner. Although signs were posted about the makeup date, cars ignored the notices and ended up blocking part of the
was pretty uneventful, which leads to a boring story. Prelims were run in 5 heats, with DTD, KapSig, and PiKA advancing to the Finals (DTD put up a Prelim time of 2:51). There were no crashes. In fact, the only thing of note that we know about is that Beta Sigma Rho was DQ’d for a pushbar violation (the DQ was not protested, as their time wasn’t fast enough to make the Finals anyway).

"Being a driver is really fun," Chen said. "I love going fast and going around the course."
