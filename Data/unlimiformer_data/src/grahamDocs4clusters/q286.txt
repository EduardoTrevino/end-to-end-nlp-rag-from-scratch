Question: What time does Leading in a Lean and Six Sigma World start in Summer 2024?

Context: (2022), the Curie model has 6B parameters, which is close to the estimate made by by Gao from EleutherAI Gao (2021). Thus, we used GPT-J (Wang & Komatsuzaki, 2021) and BLOOM (Scao et al., 2022) models with 6 and 7 billion parameters, respectively. Although other open-source models can potentially be used, generation of synthetic queries is quite expensive and exploring other open-source options is left for future work.

was pretty uneventful, which leads to a boring story. Prelims were run in 5 heats, with DTD, KapSig, and PiKA advancing to the Finals (DTD put up a Prelim time of 2:51). There were no crashes. In fact, the only thing of note that we know about is that Beta Sigma Rho was DQ’d for a pushbar violation (the DQ was not protested, as their time wasn’t fast enough to make the Finals anyway). Finals. The Finals was a very tight race (see photo right).

First Non-Greek Orgs. 14 Organizations were entered for Raceday in 1948. They included all 12 fraternities (ATO, Beta, Beta Sigma Rho, DTD, DU, KapSig, PhiKap, PiKA, SAE, SigNu, Tau Delta Phi, and Theta Xi), the Men’s Dorms, and Citcom Clan (the commuters – “Citcom” is short for “CIT Commuter”). Although the Men’s Dorms were permitted to enter as far back as 1928, this is the first year that we have evidence that any organization other than a Greek actually did so. Training started in April,
