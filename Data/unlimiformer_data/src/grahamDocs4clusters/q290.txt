the 3 teams qualifying for Finals, broke the post-war record. In the finals, it was another close battle, with DTD squeaking it out over PiKA. DTD’s winning time of 2:42.5 was fast enough to set the course record, and PiKA’s 2:43.5 was only ½ second behind the prior record. SAE’s Best Design.

The MSAII program conducts an academic progress re view at the conclusion of each semester in

order to monitor individual student progress towa rd graduation. Should a student’s effort fall
