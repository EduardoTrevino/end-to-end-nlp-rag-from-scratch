Question: What does FLARE stand for?

Context: FLARE is applicable to any existing LMs at inference time without additional training. Con-
long texts, where continually gathering in- formation throughout generation is essential. In this work, we provide a generalized view of ac- tive retrieval augmented generation, methods that actively decide when and what to retrieve across the course of the generation. We propose Forward-Looking Active REtrieval augmented generation (FLARE), a generic method which iteratively uses a prediction of the upcoming sentence to anticipate future content, which is then utilized as a query to retrieve
The initial query of FLARE. FLARE starts with the user input x as the initial query to re- trieve documents to generate the first sentence Ë†s1 = LM([Dx, x]) to bootstrap the iterative gener- ation process. For the following steps, the tempo- rary forward-looking sentence is generated without retrieved documents.

What is a Tartan?
This year Fringe is planning to roll four different vehicles, built and maintained in the Fringe workshop in the basement of the East Campus Garage, known as the "Froom."

"We're used to saying everything with 'fr' in front of it but when we say something in front of other people, it gets them confused," said Fringe head mechanic Dave Singh, who will graduate in May with a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering and biomedical engineering.
Fringe vehicles often are named with the letter "B," like Boson, Blueshift, Bissa and Bumper. Other teams, such as Apex, often use names that connotate fire, while the SDC (Student Dormitory Committee) team, uses names such as Vice, Bane, Avarice and Malice.

This year's buggy names will be under wraps until Thursday, when the Buggy Showcase will take place from noon to 2 p.m. in Weigand Gymnasium in the Cohon University Center. It's one of the few times spectators can see buggies up close.
