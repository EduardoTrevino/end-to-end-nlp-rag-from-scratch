Question: What is StyleRF's solution to the three-way dilemma in 3D style transfer?

Context: 3D style transfer aims to render stylized novel views of a 3D scene with multi-view consistency. However, most ex- isting work suffers from a three-way dilemma over accu- rate geometry reconstruction, high-quality stylization, and being generalizable to arbitrary new styles. We propose StyleRF (Style Radiance Fields), an innovative 3D style transfer technique that resolves the three-way dilemma by performing style transformation within the feature space of a radiance ﬁeld. StyleRF employs an
In this paper, we present StyleRF, a novel zero-shot 3D style transfer method that balances the three-way dilemma over accurate geometry reconstruction, high-quality styliza- tion, and being generalizable to arbitrary new styles. By representing the 3D scene with an explicit grid of high- level features, we can faithfully restore high-ﬁdelity ge- ometry through volume rendering. Then we perform style transfer on the feature space of the scene, leading to high- quality zero-shot stylization
However, the current 3D style transfer is facing a three- way dilemma over accurate geometry reconstruction, high- quality stylization, and being generalizable to new styles. Different approaches have been investigated to resolve the three-way dilemma. For example, multiple style trans- fer [11, 22] requires a set of pre-deﬁned styles but can- not generalize to unseen new styles. Point-cloud-based style transfer [19, 37] requires a pre-trained depth estima- tion module that is prone to

Teams in the outside lane are given a 3 yard head start due to being required to go the long way around the traffic dummy Each pusher must have at least 1 hand on the buggy at all times, except in the transition zone; but no more than 1 pusher may be in contact with the buggy at any time In addition to the driver, pushers, and alternates, Rosters also included all designers and builders Buggies entered in Design Comp must also finish the race in order to qualify (but exceptions are permitted)
Tartan, Heat 1 saw a very tight race between KapSig, DTD, and PiKA, with KapSig winning in 3:24.5, DTD finishing in 3:25.1, and PiKA finishing in 3:26.3. Those were the top 3 times and they advanced to the finals. Prelim Heat 2 paired Beta, SAE, and DU, and SAE won the heat by default, as Beta was DQ’d for a pushbar violation and DU was DQ’d for a Hill 4-5 transition violation (the Tartan reports that they “shoved the buggy into the last zone instead of pushing it”). Prelims Heat 3 was a battle
Depending on Friday and Saturday's conditions, most heats may run just two lanes instead of three. But still, despite some of the challenges, Chen said she wouldn't miss it.

"Being a driver is really fun," Chen said. "I love going fast and going around the course."
