help much, in which case it may be better to use a constant budget. It may also be not fast enough during the last iter- ations: suppose 95% of the problems are solved, but the re- maining 5% ones require to double the budget k more times: then the 95% will be resolved k more times (possibly finding different solutions), and, if the found solutions change, opti- mization is also performed k times before any new problem can be solved. By contrast, Orseau and Lelis [2021] use a fixed budget and
rewrites in each qualification task. Those who accurately answer at least five of the six questions (three for style and at least two for naturalness) are approved for the main task. Once approved, we pay them $0.27 USD per head-to-head comparison.
