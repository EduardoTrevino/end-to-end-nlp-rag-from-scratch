Question: What percentage of CMU's Computer Science first year students in 2019 were women?

Context: Of the academics interviewed, there was an even split between early, mid, and late career (6/33% each). Of those in industry, 6 (75%) were individual contributors and 2 (25%) were research managers. Our sample is only 19% women, which is likely representative, as women comprise approximately 15% of tenure-track computer science faculty in the US (Way et al., 2016). For more discussion of the sample characteristics, see 7. Our positive response rate was 82%.

Timnit Gebru,
We recruited 26 researchers to participate in inter- views using purposive (Campbell et al., 2020) and snowball sampling (Parker et al., 2019): asking participants to recommend other candidates, and purposively selecting for diversity in affiliation, ca- reer stage, geographic position, and research area (see participant demographics in Appendix A.1). Our sample had a 69-31% academia-industry split, was 19% women, and 27% of participants identi- fied as part of a minoritized group in the field.

“Buggy doesn’t exist anywhere else. It’s a 100-year love of creation and collaboration,” said Olivia Keller at dawn on the inaugural morning practice — called first rolls — in late September. “That the alumni network can be so involved, that they continue to be passionate about buggy long after they’ve gone is very telling of how amazing and special buggy is. It’s part of the CMU experience,” said the senior chemical engineering major, pusher and chair of this year’s Kappa Kappa Gamma and Kappa
Tishya Girdhar, a junior in neuroscience, is social chair for Fringe. She came to CMU wanting to drive, but first she had to get over being claustrophobic. She started as a mechanic and got behind the wheel for last year's Sweepstakes.

"Our team's philosophy is to teach everyone how to do everything," Girdhar said. "But I came to CMU wanting to drive. I wanted to drive so badly."
