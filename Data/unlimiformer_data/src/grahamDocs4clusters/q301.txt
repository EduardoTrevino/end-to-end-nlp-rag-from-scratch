Question: In spring 2025, When do Mini-3 course drop and withdrawal grade assignment occur?

Context: et al. (2022), who observed that only monoT5-3B (but not a much smaller monoT5-220M) outperformed BM25 on all collections. Strong performance of MiniLM-L6-30M in our study was due to additional training with consistency-checked data and pre-training on all-domain data (all queries from all collections). To confirm the effectiveness of these procedures, we carried out ablation experiments.
Sachan et al. (2022) evaluated their method using only QA (but not IR) datasets and their main results are for an impractically large three-billion parameter instruction-finetuned model, which was used essentially as a re-ranker (in a zero-shot scenario). The smallest model used by Sachan et al. (2022) had 250 million parameters (compared to our 30-million MiniLM model). It was evaluated only on the Natural Questions (NQ) collection (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019) where it outperformed BM25 by about
– Outperforming BM25 with a small ranking model such as MiniLM-30M was possible by using: (a) a better model to generate synthetic training data (BLOOM instead of GPT-3 Curie), (b) consistency checking (Dai et al., 2022) (RQ3), and (c) all-domain pre-training, each of which helped improve outcomes.

Delta Upsilon entered a three-wheeled buggy in 1940.

It’s quirky, it’s different, and it’s so Carnegie Mellon University, where the college experience is a little buggy.

Sweepstakes, better known as the Spring Carnival Buggy Races, will celebrate its 100th anniversary April 17-18, 2020. The CMU tradition is unlike any other.
Fight Over Carnival Schedule. Now that Spring Carnival was back on, the students had to decide how they wanted it – As 2 days in May (losing a day of vacation) or one day in April (not sacrificing any other off days). Buggy was going to happen either way, but ultimately the students voted on a 2 day Carnival, keeping the tradition intact and putting Raceday on the schedule for May 2-3. Time Trials. It looks like this post-war period was when the race changed from a head-to-head to a time trial.
The Finals, initially scheduled for 2pm on Saturday, May 4, were ultimately postponed until Saturday, May 11, due to a downpour that cast a damper on an otherwise exciting Spring Carnival. Controversial Finals. An overcast sky threatened rain on the makeup date as well, though it held off long enough for the race to be run. But some of the spectators may have wished the rain came sooner. Although signs were posted about the makeup date, cars ignored the notices and ended up blocking part of the
