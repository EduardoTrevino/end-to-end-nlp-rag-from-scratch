Fight Over Carnival Schedule. Now that Spring Carnival was back on, the students had to decide how they wanted it – As 2 days in May (losing a day of vacation) or one day in April (not sacrificing any other off days). Buggy was going to happen either way, but ultimately the students voted on a 2 day Carnival, keeping the tradition intact and putting Raceday on the schedule for May 2-3. Time Trials. It looks like this post-war period was when the race changed from a head-to-head to a time trial.
