Question: What time in the day does SafeWalk end?

Context: If-needed rules are not checked until a value is explicitly requested, so adding knowledge ‚Äú10:30 AM is the start time of meeting 27‚Äù and ‚Äú11:30 AM is the end time of meeting 27‚Äù should not activate any triggers. The absence of any inherited triggers on {start time} and {end time} ensures this behavior. Once the value for the slot Ô¨Åller {the duration of meeting 27} is requested, an upscan is performed on role node {duration}, which Ô¨Ånds trigger (R C). This trigger is activated by substituting
Suppose we Ô¨Ånd out that ‚Äú11:30 AM is the end time of meeting 27‚Äù and add this to the knowledge base. This causes an upscan on {end time} to Ô¨Ånd inherited rule triggers, which Ô¨Ånds trigger (R B C) on {end time}. Activating the rule trigger by substituting {11:30 AM} for B and {meeting 27} for C (as shown in Figure 4.5) is successful because there are no violated predicates, so the search algorithm looks for an element for the unsubstituted variable A.

of reaction time it starts to decelerate and brakes at a distance of ùë• meters. In order to avoid a collision with the obstacle, the left AGV needs to generate sufficient deceleration. However, if the deceleration is too large, it may cause the goods on the AGV to slide or even fall thus causing a safety hazard.

The Finals, initially scheduled for 2pm on Saturday, May 4, were ultimately postponed until Saturday, May 11, due to a downpour that cast a damper on an otherwise exciting Spring Carnival. Controversial Finals. An overcast sky threatened rain on the makeup date as well, though it held off long enough for the race to be run. But some of the spectators may have wished the rain came sooner. Although signs were posted about the makeup date, cars ignored the notices and ended up blocking part of the
Buggy is Back! The War is over, and Spring Carnival is back with Buggy! The first year back was a short one though, as Spring Carnival was only a 2-day event, kicking off with Buggy at 4:30pm on Friday. The field was small (only 9 teams), as not all of the fraternities on campus had reactivated following the War. Buggy secrecy came back as well, as the April 30, 1946 Tartan reported that DU was building their new buggy off-campus, and were so secretive about it that not even their brothers had
Fight Over Carnival Schedule. Now that Spring Carnival was back on, the students had to decide how they wanted it ‚Äì As 2 days in May (losing a day of vacation) or one day in April (not sacrificing any other off days). Buggy was going to happen either way, but ultimately the students voted on a 2 day Carnival, keeping the tradition intact and putting Raceday on the schedule for May 2-3. Time Trials. It looks like this post-war period was when the race changed from a head-to-head to a time trial.
