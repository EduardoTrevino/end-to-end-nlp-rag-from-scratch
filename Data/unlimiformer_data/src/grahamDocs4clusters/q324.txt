Question: In Fall 2023, how many sections did Shop Skills 48104 have?

Context: find top 100 tables using the single retrieval skill following (Ma et al., 2022a). Then we break down tables into rows and use the reranking skill to keep only top 200 rows. Then for each row, expanded query retrieval and linking skills are used to find the second-hop passages, where we keep top 10 pas- sages from every expanded query retrieval and top 1 passage from every linked entity. Finally, we ap- ply the same heuristics, as done in Ma et al. (2022a) to construct the final top 100

Spring 2024
Déjà vu. Much like the prior years, the Tartan didn’t seem too interested with Buggy in 1949. So what we know is that 1949 seems very similar to 1948. Once again, 14 organizations (all 12 fraternities, Dorm Council and Citcom Clan) entered the race, and Prelims were run in 5 heats. The first 4 Heats had 3 buggies each, while the 5th Heat had only 2. Record-Breaking Year. There was little, if any, doubt that a course record would be broken this year. And in fact, each of DTD, PiKA, and KapSig,
Safety is a top priority for teams. All drivers are required to have five pieces of safety gear: mouth guard, goggles, a harness that includes three points of contact to the body of the buggy, gloves and a helmet. And during practice runs and races, flaggers man the course to let drivers know if it's safe to proceed.

Under this section there are YouTube videos with the following captions underneath them.

"Members of Fringe, celebrating their 50th year of Buggy racing, allowed a rare visit into its shop for a behind-the-scenes tour."
