Question: In the paper "Inference-Time Policy Adapters (IPA): Tailoring Extreme-Scale LMs without Fine-tuning", on which tasks has IPA shown significant improvements?

Context: We propose Inference-time Policy Adapters (IPA), which efficiently tailors a language model such as GPT-3 without fine-tuning it. IPA guides a large base model during decod- ing time through a lightweight policy adapter trained to optimize an arbitrary user objective with reinforcement learning.

Drawing inspiration from RL and inference- time techniques, we propose Inference-time Pol- icy Adapters ( IPA), an efficient and general- izable algorithm, which tailors a large language model at decoding-time toward desired objectives without fine-tuning it. To do so, IPA combines a large base LM’s output distribution with that of a smaller-sized model (a lightweight adapter pol- icy), and optimizes the combined distribution to- wards a given objective with RL (Figure 1).

1946 – PiKA’s Buggy (from the 1947 Thistle). It didn’t win Design Competition, but it had the best aesthetic design. Prelim Heats and Results. The Prelims were run in 3 heats, with 3 teams in each. The rules initially stated that the winner of each heat would compete in the finals, but it seems that the rules changed to be the three fastest times instead, as the Prelim results printed in the May 7, 1946 Tartan indicate that the Finals was just a rematch of Prelim Heat 1. According to the May 7
the 3 teams qualifying for Finals, broke the post-war record. In the finals, it was another close battle, with DTD squeaking it out over PiKA. DTD’s winning time of 2:42.5 was fast enough to set the course record, and PiKA’s 2:43.5 was only ½ second behind the prior record. SAE’s Best Design. SAE took home the trophy for Design Comp with their sleek aluminum buggy. Unfortunately, we haven’t found a photo. [Ed. Update: Based on the buggies from 1950, the 1950 Thistle’s actual description of

5.1.2 Double-Dipping

A Masters student who uses courses taken as part of another degree program (at Carnegie

Mellon or elsewhere) toward their program requirements cannot use those same courses MLT Graduate Student Handbook  Page 21

toward any other M.S. degree offered by the School of Computer Science without prior

approval. This is an SCS- wide policy.

5.1.3 Pass/Fail Grades
LTI follows the long -standing SCS policy that both the new and old advisors need to agree to

the change; typically, this is not a problem, assuming the new advisor has agreed in advance, as

described here. It is to the student' s advantage to avoid switching advisors, especially late in

their graduate studies, because forging a strong student- advisor relationship takes time.
