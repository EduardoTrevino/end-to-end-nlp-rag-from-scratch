Question: In the paper "An Approach to Ontological Learning from Weak Labels", what dataset and ontology were used in the investigation?

Context: Label ambiguity remains a fundamental challenge in Partial Label Learning (PLL). The most straight- forward approach to handling PLL is the average-based method, which assumes an equal probability for each candidate label being the ground-truth label. For instance, Hüllermeier & Beringer (2006) employed k-nearest neighbors for label disambiguation, treating all candidate labels of a sample’s neighborhood equally and predicting the ground-truth label through voting strategies. However, a
Additionally, some work has focused on semi-supervised partial label learning (Wang et al., 2019b; Wang & Zhang, 2020). An iterative label propagation process is proposed in these studies, operating between partially labeled examples and unlabeled instances, which helps clarify the candidate label sets of the partially labeled examples and assign valid labels to unlabeled instances. However, these methods don’t scale well to larger datasets like CIFAR-10.
Following previous work (Xu et al., 2022; Wen et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2022a), we evaluate our method on partial label learning setting using CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and CUB-200 (Welinder et al., 2010). We generate partially labeled datasets by flipping negative labels to false positive labels with a probability q, which is also denoted as a partial ratio. Specifically, the C − 1 negative labels are uniformly aggregated into the ground truth label to form a set of label candidates. We consider q

In the spring, the Task Force partnered with SME Branding — a firm with more than 17 years of experience creating mascots for professional sports teams and universities — to develop the graphics for the mascot. During October, students and alumni reviewed potential mascot images in focus groups.
The mascot selection process included a series of surveys and a university Town Hall meeting. Nearly 78 percent of 2,370 students surveyed in February 2007 voted for the Scottish terrier, and approximately 25 percent of 400 alumni surveyed thought the Scottish terrier was already the mascot.
Fringe vehicles often are named with the letter "B," like Boson, Blueshift, Bissa and Bumper. Other teams, such as Apex, often use names that connotate fire, while the SDC (Student Dormitory Committee) team, uses names such as Vice, Bane, Avarice and Malice.

This year's buggy names will be under wraps until Thursday, when the Buggy Showcase will take place from noon to 2 p.m. in Weigand Gymnasium in the Cohon University Center. It's one of the few times spectators can see buggies up close.
