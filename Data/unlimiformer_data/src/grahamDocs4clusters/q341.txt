An “LTI course ” is any 12 -unit course with a number of 11 -XXX; a  6-unit course with 11 -XXX

counts as one- half of an LTI course. Unless otherwise specified, "course" means an actual

classroom course, not  credit given for research or independent study. Note that the LTI  allow s

any one MLD (10 -XXX) graduate course to count as an "LTI course".
