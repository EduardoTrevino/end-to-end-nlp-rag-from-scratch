Question: What 11-6XX courses were not taught by LTI faculty in Spring 2024?

Context: Rajkumar Ramamurthy*, Prithviraj Ammanabrolu*, Kianté Brantley, Jack Hessel, Rafet Sifa, Christian Bauckhage, Hannaneh Hajishirzi, and Yejin Choi. 2023. Is reinforcement learning (not) for natural lan- guage processing: Benchmarks, baselines, and build- ing blocks for natural language policy optimization. In International Conference on Learning Representa- tions (ICLR).
In their experiments, Orseau and Lelis [2021] showed that LTS+NN performs well on two of the three evaluated do- mains (Sokoban and The Witness), but fails to learn a pol- icy for the 24-Sliding Tile Puzzle (STP). We show that LTS with context models optimized with the LTS loss within the Bootstrap process is able to learn a strong policy for all three domains evaluated, including the STP. We also show that LTS using context models is able to learn a policy that allows it to find solutions to

Delta Upsilon entered a three-wheeled buggy in 1940.

It’s quirky, it’s different, and it’s so Carnegie Mellon University, where the college experience is a little buggy.

Sweepstakes, better known as the Spring Carnival Buggy Races, will celebrate its 100th anniversary April 17-18, 2020. The CMU tradition is unlike any other.
First Non-Greek Orgs. 14 Organizations were entered for Raceday in 1948. They included all 12 fraternities (ATO, Beta, Beta Sigma Rho, DTD, DU, KapSig, PhiKap, PiKA, SAE, SigNu, Tau Delta Phi, and Theta Xi), the Men’s Dorms, and Citcom Clan (the commuters – “Citcom” is short for “CIT Commuter”). Although the Men’s Dorms were permitted to enter as far back as 1928, this is the first year that we have evidence that any organization other than a Greek actually did so. Training started in April,
The streets of the race course haven't changed, but the condition of the course varies due to potholes, which can make or break a fast run. The last course records were set in 2017, but this year potholes are making for some challenging conditions, said Amy Chen, a senior in psychology who has been driving for four years.

With the vehicles just inches from the ground, "even poorly filled potholes makes it dangerous to drive," she added.

by actual classroom courses, not credit given for research or independent study.

An “LTI course ” is any 12 -unit course with a number of 11 -XXX; a  6-unit course with 11 -XXX

counts as one- half of an LTI course. Unless otherwise specified, "course" means an actual

classroom course, not  credit given for research or independent study. Note that the LTI  allow s

any one MLD (10 -XXX) graduate course to count as an "LTI course".

4.4 Definitions of LTI Terminology

We define here some of the terms as used in this handbook:

An “LTI course” is any 12 -unit course with a number of 11 -XXX; a 6 -unit course with an

11-XXX counts as 1/2 of an LTI course. Unless otherwise specified, "course" means an

actual classroom course, not  credit given for research or independent study. Note that

we will allow any one MLD (10 -xxx) graduate- level course to count as an “LTI course.”
