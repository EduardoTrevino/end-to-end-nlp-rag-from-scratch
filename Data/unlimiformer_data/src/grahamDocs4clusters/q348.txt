Question: What are the number of units for 11797?

Context: 66(5), 1165–1178. https:// doi. org/ 10. 1007/ s11423- 018- 9591-0
= 16t + 24t − 24 + 224t − 128 + 81t2 − 117t + 45 + 432t2 − 672t + 288 + 576t2 − 832t + 320 = 1089t2 − 1357t + 501

Likewise, based on the information presented in Table 2, we obtain

M∗

2 (G) = 16t + 108t2 − 132t + 36 + 224t − 128 + 432t2 − 672t + 288 + 576t2 − 832t + 320

= 1116t2 − 1396t + 516

And from Table 3, one has

M∗

2 (G) = (cid:31) (cid:31)

E(2,4)(cid:31) (cid:31) = 16t + 288t2 − 160t + 1152t2 − 1728t + 704 = 1440t2 − 1872 + 704

E(2,2)(cid:31) (cid:31)

E(4,4)(cid:31) (cid:31)

But a few of the specific rules changed slightly, or are worth noting again: All drivers, pushers, designers and builders were required to members of the organization they’re competing for All team members (including designers and builders) must be “eligible” under the Executive Board’s requirements, which include a minimum of 36 units and being in good academic standing (with a minimum GPA requirement). The buggy/driver combo must weigh a minimum of 180 pounds (up from the previous 160 lbs)
Safety is a top priority for teams. All drivers are required to have five pieces of safety gear: mouth guard, goggles, a harness that includes three points of contact to the body of the buggy, gloves and a helmet. And during practice runs and races, flaggers man the course to let drivers know if it's safe to proceed.

A student may not take more than 60 units per semester, without permission from their academic advisor. Students must maintain full-time enrollment status (minimum of 36 units) in their final semester. 3.3.4 Prerequisite Core Course All MCDS students are expected to pass the 11-637 Foundations of Computational Data Science course by the end of their first semester. Each student must pass 11-637 with a grade of “B” or better. 3.3.5 Plan of study The degree consists of two timing options based on
10-605, Machine Learning with Large Data sets (12 units). First spring semester.

11-611, Natural Language Processing (12 units). Second fall semester.

11-785, Deep Learning (12 unit s). Second spring semester.

One more 12-unit AI, ML or NLP course of the student’s choice (with approval of the

Program Director)

In the event that a course is not available, a course covering equivalent material with a
o project -oriented Masters ’ thesis;

Of the remaining 24 unit s, 12 must be 11- 910 Directed Research ;

The final 12 units are an Open Elective.

The student must also complete two summers of full -time directed research, attend the LTI

Colloquium (11 -700) each semester, and satisfy the Research Speaking Requirement desc ribed

elsewhere.

Since 11 -791 is not being offered currently, the faculty have defined a list of acceptable

substitute courses:
