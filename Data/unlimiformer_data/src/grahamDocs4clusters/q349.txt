Question: In the paper "KIT’s Multilingual Speech Translation System for IWSLT 2023", what approach was used for effective adaptation in the absence of training data from the target domain?

Context: In this paper, we described our systems for the mul- tilingual speech translation track of IWSLT 2023, which translates English speech into 10 target lan- guages. To tackle the task of translating scien- tific conference talks, which feature non-native in- put speech and terminology-dense contents, our systems have several novelties. Lacking suitable training data for the target domain, we used kNN- MT for inference-time adaptation and showed an improvement of +0.8 BLEU for cascaded speech

system, we use our machine translation model for knowledge distillation. We also ensemble models trained with and without synthesized speech data.

Our main findings are as follow:

Since the first Campus Week in 1920, when “chariots” were built to race around campus, student groups have been working year-round, using their engineering skills, design expertise and penchant for interdisciplinary collaboration to secretly build, modify and refine the most aerodynamic, torpedo-like vessel they call a “buggy.”
In the spring, the Task Force partnered with SME Branding — a firm with more than 17 years of experience creating mascots for professional sports teams and universities — to develop the graphics for the mascot. During October, students and alumni reviewed potential mascot images in focus groups.
The Kiltie Band is a campus organization recognized by Student Senate and administered by the Department of Athletics, Physical Education and Recreation. Membership is open to all members of the campus/community without audition. Participants must do their best to promote the success of the ensemble through attendance, attitude, and dependability.
