Question: In spring 2024, What is the deadline for withdrawing from a semester course with a withdrawal grade assigned?

Context: Developers who do not wish their source code to be used for training code LLMs are given the op- portunity to opt-out of The Stack (Kocetkov et al., 2022). We received 9 opt-out requests before the cut-off date for removing data (31 October 2022). These individuals accounted for 299 repositories. Of these, 161 were already excluded from The Stack v1.0 (because they did not have a permissive license), and 138 were in The Stack v1.0. We honored the requests to opt-out and removed these
repositories from The Stack v1.1. After the cut-off date (31 October 2022), we have received more requests for requests and we will remove these repositories prior to releasing The Stack v1.2.
