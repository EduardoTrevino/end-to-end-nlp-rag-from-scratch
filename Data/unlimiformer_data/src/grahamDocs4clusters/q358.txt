Question: Which LTI professor's paper introduced the TASTE algorithm that maps items and users in an embedding space and recommends items by matching their text representations?

Context: ABSTRACT This paper proposes Text mAtching based SequenTial rEcommenda- tion model (TASTE), which maps items and users in an embedding space and recommends items by matching their text representa- tions. TASTE verbalizes items and user-item interactions using identifiers and attributes of items. To better characterize user be- haviors, TASTE additionally proposes an attention sparsity method, which enables TASTE to model longer user-item interactions by reducing the self-attention computations
Compared with item id embedding based recommendation mod- els, e.g. Bert4Rec, TASTE almost doubles its recommendation per- formance, thriving on modeling relevance between users and items through text-matching signals. TASTE also outperforms the previ- ous state-of-the-art recommendation model, DIF-SR, which lever- ages item attributes as side information to help better learn user behaviors from user-item interactions beyond item identifiers. It represents item attributes as embeddings and
In this paper, we propose Text mAtching based SequenTial rEcommendation (TASTE), which represents items and users with texts, establishes relevance between them by matching their text representations and alleviates the popularity bias of previous item id based recommendation models. TASTE verbalizes users and items by designing some prompts [39] and filling up the templates with item ids and item attributes. The item information provides text- matching clues to model the dependency and

In the spring, the Task Force partnered with SME Branding — a firm with more than 17 years of experience creating mascots for professional sports teams and universities — to develop the graphics for the mascot. During October, students and alumni reviewed potential mascot images in focus groups.

the first month of the program. Students are expected to attend the LTI's Orientation lectures,

(Section 3.3) in which faculty describe their interests and areas of expertise, and to be proactive

about meeting individually with potential advisors. After meeting with several potential advisors,

each student will be asked to indicate a first, second and third choice for advisor. Meanwhile,  the
