suited for our tasks: fastText (Grave et al., 2018), BPEmb (Heinzerling and Strube, 2018), BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) and INSTRUCTOR (Su et al., 2022). We chose these embeddings be- cause they are open (i.e., they provide embeddings even to words unseen in the training data). All of these embeddings except for BERT and INSTRUC- TOR are 300-dimensional (see Section 5.5).

Fairings have been a key feature for the Fringe team in recent years, which is celebrating its 50th anniversary of Buggy.

"We have a reputation of being the quietest on the course," said Diya Nuxoll, who wrapped up her bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering in December and is working on an advanced studies master's degree in design and manufacturing. Nuxoll leads the Fringe team as one of two head mechanics.
The streets of the race course haven't changed, but the condition of the course varies due to potholes, which can make or break a fast run. The last course records were set in 2017, but this year potholes are making for some challenging conditions, said Amy Chen, a senior in psychology who has been driving for four years.

With the vehicles just inches from the ground, "even poorly filled potholes makes it dangerous to drive," she added.
