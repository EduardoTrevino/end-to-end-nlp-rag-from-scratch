Question: How many datasets does GlobalBench currently cover?

Context: for different tasks. MultiBench spans 10 diverse modalities (images, video, audio, text, time-series, various robotics sensors, sets, and tables), 15 prediction tasks (humor, sentiment, emotions, mortality rate, ICD-9 codes, image-captions, human activities, digits, robot pose, object pose, robot contact, and design interfaces), and 5 research areas (affective computing, healthcare, multimedia, robotics, and HCI). These datasets are designed to test a combination of feature learning and
Fusion experiments: In Table 6 and 7 we present more detailed results on the Multibench [44] and IRFL [87] datasets computed from 5 independent runs. FACTORCL significantly outperforms the baselines that do not capture both shared and unique information in both supervised and self- supervised settings, particularly on MUSTARD (where unique information expresses sarcasm, such as sardonic facial expressions or ironic tone of voice), and on MIMIC (with unique health indicators and sensor
Table 6: Results of six dataset combination configurations of 1.3B models and our LBS-7B model details are presented in Sec. 6. Bigbench is evaluated under 3-shot using the average of multiple choice grade. Arc easy and arc challenge are evaluated using 5-shot, 25-shot, and 25-shot, respectively. All other eval- uation benchmarks are tested on 0-shot. * represents the results are averaged across multiple sub-items inside each benchmark dataset.

Déjà vu. Much like the prior years, the Tartan didn’t seem too interested with Buggy in 1949. So what we know is that 1949 seems very similar to 1948. Once again, 14 organizations (all 12 fraternities, Dorm Council and Citcom Clan) entered the race, and Prelims were run in 5 heats. The first 4 Heats had 3 buggies each, while the 5th Heat had only 2. Record-Breaking Year. There was little, if any, doubt that a course record would be broken this year. And in fact, each of DTD, PiKA, and KapSig,
rules carried over from the pre-war era, including that track and cross-country runners were ineligible, buggies must stay in their lanes on the front hills, buggies may have no less than 3 and no more than 5 wheels, and no switching of drivers.
out how many pedestrians they had hit”). The impact was severe enough that KapSig’s buggy was dented, and the time it lost from the impact made it impossible for them to catch up. PiKA eventually passed DTD in the freeroll and went on to win by 30 yards, but by then it didn’t matter. The judges decided to DQ PiKA for interference. The brothers of PiKA didn’t take it lightly though; they immediately lodged a protest against the judge’s decision.
