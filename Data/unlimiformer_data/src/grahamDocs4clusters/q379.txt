Question: What's the cost in us dollars per program for the masters degrees in language technologies if you submit before the early deadline?

Context: for Google Translate is roughly $2.66 re- gardless of the target language, since Google’s API only charges for input characters.
We estimated cost values for each MT system and language: the expense, in USD, of translat- ing the full FLORES-200 devtest English set into the language. We estimated costs of GPT models using the prompts employed in our experiments,

model NLLB ChatGPT (0-shot) ChatGPT (5-shot) Google GPT-4 (5-shot)

cost $0.09 $0.35 $1.32 $2.66 $25.93

Table 10: Estimated cost in USD to translate FLORES- 200 devtest ENG→X with each system, averaged across all languages we evaluated with each
These visualizations are also available on our repository. (Also see our Zeno browser for interac- tive visualizations of our results.) We also include cost estimates and scores divided thereby for all languages and MT systems in Table 14. We ex- clude cost estimates by language for NLLB and Google because there is very little variation be- tween languages. Our estimated cost of translat- ing FLORES-200 devtest ENG→ is approximately $0.09 for every target language. And the respective estimate

The starting line from the inaugural race in June 1920 was outside what is now known as the College of Fine Arts building. Racers then traveled toward Margaret Morrison Carnegie Hall, went up Tech Street, down through Schenley Park and then turned back to campus. Buggies would then take pit stops and have their rear wheels swapped before heading back toward the starting line.
