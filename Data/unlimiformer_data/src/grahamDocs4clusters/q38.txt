Question: How much does it cost to apply for the MLT program if an application is submitted on the day before the deadline?

Context: receive 6 scores, and we use the average score as the final score for each response. The response with the higher final score is considered the better response. The GPT-4 evaluation incurred a cost of $20.45 for InstructBlip and $20.90 for MiniGPT-4.

Table 11: Template used to query GPT-4 for evaluating the response quality of different models.
rewrites in each qualification task. Those who accurately answer at least five of the six questions (three for style and at least two for naturalness) are approved for the main task. Once approved, we pay them $0.27 USD per head-to-head comparison.
costs $156.82, training a distilled GPT-3 as the approximate policy requires only $28.59 for generating outputs from GPT-3. Our results high- light the potential of the IPA as a cost-efficient way to enhance the capabilities of LLMs.
