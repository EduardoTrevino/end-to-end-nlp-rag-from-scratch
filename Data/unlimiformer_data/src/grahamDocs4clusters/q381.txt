Pragmatic Inference with a CLIP Listener for Contrastive Captioning

Abstract
We propose an incremental pragmatic inference ap- proach with a CLIP listener, which combines the strengths of previous approaches that conduct in- cremental pragmatic reasoning with a separately modeled listener. We identify strengths and weak- nesses of automatic model-based evaluation of dis- criminative captioning systems, and suggest that future work 1) control for the disfluency of gener- ated captions and not solely optimize for predicted informativity and 2) use human evaluations.

Déjà vu. Much like the prior years, the Tartan didn’t seem too interested with Buggy in 1949. So what we know is that 1949 seems very similar to 1948. Once again, 14 organizations (all 12 fraternities, Dorm Council and Citcom Clan) entered the race, and Prelims were run in 5 heats. The first 4 Heats had 3 buggies each, while the 5th Heat had only 2. Record-Breaking Year. There was little, if any, doubt that a course record would be broken this year. And in fact, each of DTD, PiKA, and KapSig,
First Non-Greek Orgs. 14 Organizations were entered for Raceday in 1948. They included all 12 fraternities (ATO, Beta, Beta Sigma Rho, DTD, DU, KapSig, PhiKap, PiKA, SAE, SigNu, Tau Delta Phi, and Theta Xi), the Men’s Dorms, and Citcom Clan (the commuters – “Citcom” is short for “CIT Commuter”). Although the Men’s Dorms were permitted to enter as far back as 1928, this is the first year that we have evidence that any organization other than a Greek actually did so. Training started in April,
front hills, causing more congestion for spectators on those hills. A police tow truck was present, but it was not permitted to clear the street. Up the front hills, DTD was in the lead, followed by PiKA and KapSig. DTD went into the freerolls first, but the drama was behind them. As PiKA entered the freeroll, PiKA’s buggy crowded KapSig’s buggy and forced KapSig wide, causing KapSig to swerve and hit at least 1 spectator (the Tartan says that KapSig “got out pencil and paper to try to figure

16. CAPTCHAs, 2000 “Spam” and malicious attacks were a growing problem on the Internet when hackers developed automated “bots” that could sign up for email and other Web services without human intervention. Luis von Ahn (CS’03,’05), Nick Hopper (CS’04), John Langford (CS’02) and CMU professor Manuel Blum invented a “Completely Automated Public Turing Test to tell Computers and Humans Apart,” or CAPTCHA, to help foil the bots. A later variation, reCAPTCHA, is helping digitize old books and
