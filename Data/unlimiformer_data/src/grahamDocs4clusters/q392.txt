Question: What does CodeBERTScore encode in addition to the generated tokens?

Context: First, CodeBERTScore encodes et al., 2020). the generated code and the reference code inde- pendently with pretrained models, with the inclu- sion of natural language instructions or comments. Then, we compute the cosine similarity between the encoded representations of each token in the generated code and each token in the reference code. Finally, the best matching token vector pairs are used to compute precision and recall. Code- BERTScore allows comparing code pairs that are lexically
Since the rise of neural natural-language-to- code models (NL→Code) that can generate long expressions and statements rather than a single next-token, one of the major prob- lems has been reliably evaluating their gen- In this paper, we propose erated output. CodeBERTScore: an evaluation metric for code generation, which builds on BERTScore (Zhang et al., 2020). Instead of encoding only the generated tokens as in BERTScore, CodeBERTScore also encodes the natural lan- guage input preceding the
Figure 2: A diagram illustrating CodeBERTScore: We use a language-specific CodeBERT model to encode each of ⟨natural_language, reference_code⟩ and ⟨natural_language, generated_code⟩. We then compute the pairwise cosine similarity between every encoded token in the reference and every encoded token in the generated code, ignoring the encoded natural language context tokens and encoded punctuation tokens; finally, we take the max across the rows of the resulting matrix to compute Precision and

front hills, causing more congestion for spectators on those hills. A police tow truck was present, but it was not permitted to clear the street. Up the front hills, DTD was in the lead, followed by PiKA and KapSig. DTD went into the freerolls first, but the drama was behind them. As PiKA entered the freeroll, PiKA’s buggy crowded KapSig’s buggy and forced KapSig wide, causing KapSig to swerve and hit at least 1 spectator (the Tartan says that KapSig “got out pencil and paper to try to figure

We don’t have many details of the race itself, but DTD took the win, just barely edging out KapSig, who was less than 1 second behind. DTD’s goggled driver was Dick Stanley, and the Hill 5 pusher working very hard was Barry Rowles. As a consolation prize, KapSig’s streamlined aluminum buggy (which looks just like a slightly larger version of today’s designs, with an extra wheel) took home the Design Comp trophy.
