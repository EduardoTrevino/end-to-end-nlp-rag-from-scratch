3.3 InPars-light Training Recipe

The InPars-light is not a new method. It is a training recipe, which a modification of the original InPars. Yet, it is substantially more cost effective for generation of synthetic queries, training the models, and inference. InPars-light has the following main “ingredients”:

Using open-source models instead of GPT-3;

Using smaller ranking BERT models instead of monoT5 rankers;

Fine-tuning models on consistency-checked training data;
We carried out a reproducibility study of InPars (Bonifacio et al., 2022), which is a method for unsupervised training of neural rankers. As a by-product of this study, we developed a simple-yet-effective modification of InPars, which we called InPars-light. Unlike InPars, InPars-light uses only a community-trained open-source language model BLOOM (with 7B parameters), 7x-100x smaller ranking models, and re-ranks only top-100 candidate records instead of top-1000.

Fringe vehicles often are named with the letter "B," like Boson, Blueshift, Bissa and Bumper. Other teams, such as Apex, often use names that connotate fire, while the SDC (Student Dormitory Committee) team, uses names such as Vice, Bane, Avarice and Malice.

This year's buggy names will be under wraps until Thursday, when the Buggy Showcase will take place from noon to 2 p.m. in Weigand Gymnasium in the Cohon University Center. It's one of the few times spectators can see buggies up close.
between PhiKap, Theta Xi, and Scobell House (Men’s Dorms), but again, Theta Xi won by default, as both PhiKap and Scobell were DQ’d for a Hill 4-5 transition violation (the same problem that DU had). Rain or Shine, But Not Really… One other rule stated that the race would be rain-or-shine. However, that didn’t turn out to be true.
