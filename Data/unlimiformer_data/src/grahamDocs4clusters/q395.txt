Question: Is a valid CMU ID needed to use the tennis court?

Context: properties. But even on the lower levels, it is easy to see that Σlp ℓ , essentially because the identifier-independent certificates chosen by the first player can be used to provide each node with a new, locally unique identifier whose validity can be verified in a constant number of communication rounds. The inclusion on the nondeterministic level is strict because not-all-selected, the property of a labeled graph having at least one unselected node, lies in indΣld
proof of Remark 1, we can assign it a valid identifier without affecting the validity of the other nodes’ identifiers. Also note that we need the restriction to graphs of ∆-bounded structural degree only for ◀ the case ℓ = 0, not for the case ℓ > 0.
CodeBLEU (Ren et al., 2020) attempts to lower the requirement for a lexical exact match, by rely- ing on data-flow and Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) matching as well; nevertheless, valid generations may have different ASTs and data flow from the reference code, which may lead to low CodeBLEU score even when the prediction is correct. Further, partial predictions may be useful for a program-
