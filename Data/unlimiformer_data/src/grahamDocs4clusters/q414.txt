Question: How many people co-authored the paper Learning to Ask Questions for Zero-shot Dialogue State Tracking?

Context: in Table1, we used zero-shot prompting with text-davinci-003 and evaluate on a test set of 342 instances. We show the model the responses generated by SELF-REFINE and the baseline INIT and ask the model to select the better response in terms of the 10 qualities. We report the win rate. However, we acknowledge that automated metrics may not provide an accurate assessment of text generation tasks and rely on human evaluation instead.

In summary, the contributions of this paper are

twofold:

1. We explore text classification in a neural matching formulation enhanced by prompts. We demonstrate that even without any finetun- ing on the text encoder, this straightforward formulation is an effective method for zero- shot text classification.

The mascot selection process included a series of surveys and a university Town Hall meeting. Nearly 78 percent of 2,370 students surveyed in February 2007 voted for the Scottish terrier, and approximately 25 percent of 400 alumni surveyed thought the Scottish terrier was already the mascot.

Up the front hills, DTD was in the lead, followed by PiKA and KapSig. DTD went into the freerolls first, but the drama was behind them. As PiKA entered the freeroll, PiKA’s buggy crowded KapSig’s buggy and forced KapSig wide, causing KapSig to swerve and hit at least 1 spectator (the Tartan says that KapSig “got out pencil and paper to try to figure
