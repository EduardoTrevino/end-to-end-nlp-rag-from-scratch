We introduce NLPositionality, a framework for characterizing design biases and positionality of NLP datasets and models. For a given dataset and task, we obtain a wide set of new annotations for a data sample, from a diverse pool of volunteers from various countries and of different backgrounds (re- cruited through LabintheWild; Reinecke and Gajos, 2015). We then quantify design biases by compar- ing which identities and backgrounds have higher agreement with the original dataset labels or

If you can ID any of the unknown buggies, let us know.

1949 – Design Competition (from the 1966 Buggy Book). Buggies are KapSig (far left), SAE’s design winner (#4, 2nd from the left), Men’s Dorms (#7, 3rd from the left), and DU (#11, far right).

1949 – SAE’s Design-winning buggy getting worked on (from the November 1949 issue of The Record, the SAE National Publication)

1949 – Citcom Clan Buggy (#9) (from the 1950 Thistle).
1946 – PiKA’s Buggy (from the 1947 Thistle). It didn’t win Design Competition, but it had the best aesthetic design. Prelim Heats and Results. The Prelims were run in 3 heats, with 3 teams in each. The rules initially stated that the winner of each heat would compete in the finals, but it seems that the rules changed to be the three fastest times instead, as the Prelim results printed in the May 7, 1946 Tartan indicate that the Finals was just a rematch of Prelim Heat 1. According to the May 7

1946 saw the return of Buggy, though not all of the Fraternities were back yet. It also saw a rain delay and a very controversial result.

Survey, interpret and comparatively criticize state of the art research talks and papers, with emphasis on constructive improvements.

Organize, execute, report on, and present a real world data science project in collaboration with other researchers/programmers.

Depending on the concentration, additional learning outcomes are emphasized:
thesis defense. The pre sentation must communicate the research work done, similar to

a conference paper presentation. The committee will observe the presentation, and then decide whether the thesis and presentation were acceptable, or whether further

work is required. Unlike a P hD defense, only a simple majority vote of the committee is

required for approval.
5.2 Conference Travel Funding  LTI Ph.D.  Graduate Student Handbook  Page 33

Students funded by research projects receive travel funding according to policies set by the

individual projects. Students who have no project funding may be provided with partial funding,

with a larger amount available for travel to p resent a refereed conference paper . There is an LTI

form that must be filled out in advance.
