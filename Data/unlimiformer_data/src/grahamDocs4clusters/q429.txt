Question: How many turing awards recipients have been from Carnegie Mellon University?

Context: [18] B. M. Elizalde. Never-ending learning of sounds. Carnegie Mellon University, 2020. [19] J. Engel, C. Resnick, A. Roberts, S. Dieleman, M. Norouzi, D. Eck, and K. Simonyan.

Searle, the Chuchlands, and Turing provide our backdrop. I will show how recent work in artificial intelligence is starting to fill the empirical gap identified by the Churchlands, providing evidence that at least some semantics may fall out of syntax, vindicating Turing’s agnostic stance (Fig. 1).

In one of the most cited artificial intelligence papers of 2020, which also won the ACL 2020 Best Theme Paper Award, Emily Bender and Alexander Koller (2020)

In its 115 years, Carnegie Mellon has soared to national and international leadership in higher education and research. A birthplace of innovation since its founding, it continues to be known for innovation, for solving real-world problems and for interdisciplinary collaboration. Its alumni can be found across the globe — from Tony Award winners to Nobel Prize and Turing Award winners, from CEOs to entrepreneurs, from professors to artists. In the 2000s, in response to demand for expanded
Turing Awards and a Nobel Prize In 1975, Simon and Newell were awarded the A.M. Turing Award for their work in artificial intelligence. (As of 2014, 12 CMU alumni or faculty have been awarded Turings, sometimes considered the Nobel Prize of computing.) Three years later, Simon received the Nobel Prize in Economics for his work on decision-making theory. As the 1970s progressed, Newell became interested in human-computer interaction, and began a long relationship with Xerox’s Palo Alto Research
awarded to Mao Yisheng, a student from China. It laid the groundwork for a research institution, recruiting leading scientists, offering sponsored fellowships with government and industry leaders and pioneering nontraditional interdisciplinary research, which brought together physicists, chemists and metallurgists, for example. Interdisciplinary research would become the hallmark of Carnegie Mellon research. It initiated the 'Carnegie Plan' in 1938, a new curriculum that required science and
