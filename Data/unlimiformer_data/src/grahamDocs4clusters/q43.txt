Question: What language did Meloni et al (2021) achieve state-of-the-art results on for protoform reconstruction?

Context: Protoform reconstruction is the task of inferring how morphemes or words sounded in ancestral languages of a set of daughter languages. Mel- oni et al. (2021) achieved the state-of-the-art on Latin protoform reconstruction with an RNN- based encoder-decoder with attention model. We update their model with the state-of-the-art seq2seq model—the Transformer. Our model outperforms their model on a suite of differ- ent metrics on two different datasets: Meloni et al.’s Romance data of 8,000+
Meloni et al. (2021) employ a GRU-based seq2seq approach (Cho et al., 2014) to Latin proto- form reconstruction and achieve state-of-the-art character edit distances. They extend Dinu and Ciobanu (2014)’s Romance data using data from Wiktionary—for a total of 8,799 cognate sets across 5 Romance languages plus Latin—in both ortho- graphic and phonetic (IPA) representations. In their model, all entries comprising the cognate set are concatenated together in a fixed order to form a training
graffiti and other informal in- scriptions. Proto-Romance reconstructions are also not exhaustive. As a result, it is difficult to find a dataset like Meloni et al. (2021) with thousands of such ancestor forms. We are also limited to the faithfulness of espeak-ng’s Latin G2P, from which Meloni et al. (2021) obtain their phonetic Romance dataset.

Beta’s new design was the winner of the first post-war Design Competition. The buggy, designed by Rick Saxton, was shaped like a bug with welded tubular steel. The real design battle seemed to be between Beta and PiKA, and the Tartan noted that PiKA’s buggy had a better appearance. However, Beta’s was structurally superior and that allowed it to take home the design trophy.
1946 – PiKA’s Buggy (from the 1947 Thistle). It didn’t win Design Competition, but it had the best aesthetic design. Prelim Heats and Results. The Prelims were run in 3 heats, with 3 teams in each. The rules initially stated that the winner of each heat would compete in the finals, but it seems that the rules changed to be the three fastest times instead, as the Prelim results printed in the May 7, 1946 Tartan indicate that the Finals was just a rematch of Prelim Heat 1. According to the May 7
1948 saw the first independent orgs and the start of DTD’s run of greatness, but it wasn’t easy, as they barely held off KapSig for the championship.
