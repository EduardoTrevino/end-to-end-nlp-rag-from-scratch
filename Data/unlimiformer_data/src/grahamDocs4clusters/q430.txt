Question: In summer 2024, When is the deadline for withdrawing from a Mini-5 course and receiving a withdrawal grade?

Context: Developers who do not wish their source code to be used for training code LLMs are given the op- portunity to opt-out of The Stack (Kocetkov et al., 2022). We received 9 opt-out requests before the cut-off date for removing data (31 October 2022). These individuals accounted for 299 repositories. Of these, 161 were already excluded from The Stack v1.0 (because they did not have a permissive license), and 138 were in The Stack v1.0. We honored the requests to opt-out and removed these
The details of the training process are as follows. We started ﬁne-tuning the mT5, by mini- mizing the maximum-likelihood loss for 15 epochs, using a batch size of 8, accumulation steps of 4, and learning rate of 10e-5 with Adafactor optimization and cosine annealing learning rate decay schedule (Loshchilov and Hutter 2016). The maximum news length was set to 512 and max- imum summary length was determined as 120. We initialized our reinforcement learning models with the ﬁne-tuned models that
