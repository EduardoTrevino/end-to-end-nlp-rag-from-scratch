Question: When was the deadline for the MLT program applications?

Context: 1Based on publications at ML (ICLR, ICML, NeurIPS) and NLP conferences (ACL, EMNLP) between 2017 and 2022

et al., 2020). Over the same period, GPU hardware accelerators have seen similar performance gains with the number of floating point operations per second (FLOPS) growing by over 175%.2
Looking ahead, we hope to expand this ML technique to other Breakthrough Listen datasets to further increase the impact of ML on SETI. This includes other GBT and Parkes data, as well as the upcoming MeerKAT22, Very Large Array (VLA)23, Square Kilometre Array24 and the next generation VLA (ngVLA; Ng et al., submitted) interferometric SETI projects.25

The Masked LM (MLM) is another type of language model for visual generation, such as: MaskGIT (Chang et al., 2022), MAGVIT (Yu et al., 2023a), Phenaki (Villegas et al., 2022), and MUSE (Chang et al., 2023), among others. An MLM is trained using a masked token objective (De-

The Finals, initially scheduled for 2pm on Saturday, May 4, were ultimately postponed until Saturday, May 11, due to a downpour that cast a damper on an otherwise exciting Spring Carnival. Controversial Finals. An overcast sky threatened rain on the makeup date as well, though it held off long enough for the race to be run. But some of the spectators may have wished the rain came sooner. Although signs were posted about the makeup date, cars ignored the notices and ended up blocking part of the

4.3 Optional Masters’  Thesis

MLT students may optionally  elect to complete a Mast ers’ Thesis; it is not  required. Students

who intend to apply for the PhD program should consider the MLT Thesis as one of several

ways to demonstrate their research potential. Other possibilities include innovative research in a research project or class project work.

The MLT Thesis must be completed according to the following guidelines. Note in particular the October 31 proposal deadline!
