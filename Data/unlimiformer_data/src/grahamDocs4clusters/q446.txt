Question: What do the KALE vocabulary semantic concepts perform better than?

Context: next-word prediction. In this paper, we set out to understand why retrieval-augmented language models, and speciﬁcally why k-nearest neighbor language models (kNN-LMs) perform better than standard parametric LMs, even when the k-nearest neighbor component retrieves examples from the same training set that the LM was originally trained on. To this end, we perform a careful analysis of the various dimensions over which kNN-LM diverges from standard LMs, and investigate these dimensions one by
Results show GEN performs overall better than D&A, but without surpassing H&S, which has the best overall results. Some conﬁgurations of GEN surpass H&S in some metrics (highlighted), but all together GEN does not surpass H&S. We can also observe that semantic metrics are less prone to distinguish the systems as lexical ones.

The FITB strategy retains the most semantic and lexical similarity to the harmful query, as evidenced by the highest BERTScore, ROUGE-L, and BLEU respectively. Based on this, we contend that FITB is more effective than the other prompting methods in generating similar strings. Therefore, we use FITB as the method to generate similar queries given harmful queries.

We don’t have many details of the race itself, but DTD took the win, just barely edging out KapSig, who was less than 1 second behind. DTD’s goggled driver was Dick Stanley, and the Hill 5 pusher working very hard was Barry Rowles. As a consolation prize, KapSig’s streamlined aluminum buggy (which looks just like a slightly larger version of today’s designs, with an extra wheel) took home the Design Comp trophy.
out how many pedestrians they had hit”). The impact was severe enough that KapSig’s buggy was dented, and the time it lost from the impact made it impossible for them to catch up. PiKA eventually passed DTD in the freeroll and went on to win by 30 yards, but by then it didn’t matter. The judges decided to DQ PiKA for interference. The brothers of PiKA didn’t take it lightly though; they immediately lodged a protest against the judge’s decision.
