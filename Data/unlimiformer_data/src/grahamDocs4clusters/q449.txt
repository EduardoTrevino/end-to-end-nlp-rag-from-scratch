Question: When did amusing buggies like Delta Upsilon's "Fish" and Printing Management's Bathtub disappear?

Context: structure-related parsing effects disappear in high γ. Importantly, Woolnough et al.

(2023) found increased γ for Jabberwocky over Pseudoword lists, but this was crucially

punctuated and not sustained across multiple words in the sentence. As such, this

likely represents a signature of the basic structure-building operation, MERGE, and

these Jabberwocky γ effects also lasted around 200–300ms, seemingly the right

Title: M.S. Project
Delta Upsilon entered a three-wheeled buggy in 1940.

It’s quirky, it’s different, and it’s so Carnegie Mellon University, where the college experience is a little buggy.

Sweepstakes, better known as the Spring Carnival Buggy Races, will celebrate its 100th anniversary April 17-18, 2020. The CMU tradition is unlike any other.
1949 – KapSig’s buggy with front hatch removed, being inspected (from the 1950 Thistle).

1949 – PiKA’s Buggy and team (from the 1950 Thistle)

1949 – ATO’s buggy (from the 1950 Thistle). The buggy is flat and white, and has side view mirrors!

1949 – KapSig’s buggy being pushed on the Back Hills (from the 1949 Thistle)

1949 – PiKA’s Buggy (from the 1950 Thistle)
system). 1948 Photos. Here are some photos from 1948. Let us know if you can ID any of the “unknown” buggies.
5. Emoticons, 1982 Sure, it was just a joke, but (for better or worse) it’s endured for more than three decades. CMU researcher Scott Fahlman created the emoticon to clear up misunderstandings on computer message boards. We’ve been looking at the world sideways ever since. :-)
7. Autonomous robots, 1983 Thanks to Red Whittaker (E'75,'79), robots moved off of the assembly lines and into places no human ever could go. His Robotic Reconnaissance Vehicle spent four years inspecting and cleaning up the contaminated reactor building at the crippled Three Mile Island nuclear plant.
