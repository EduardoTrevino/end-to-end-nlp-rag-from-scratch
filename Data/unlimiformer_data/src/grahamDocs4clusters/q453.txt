Question: How does CSurF address sparse lexicon-based retrieval?

Context: Paper title: 'CSurF: Sparse Lexical Retrieval through Contextualized Surface Forms' Published year: 2023 Publication venue or conference: International Conference on the Theory of Information Retrieval Authors: Zhen Fan, Jamie Callan, Luyu Gao Summary: This paper proposes to directly bridge the surface form space and the term semantics space in lexical exact-match retrieval via contextualized surface forms (CSF), reaching comparable accuracy as lexical all-to-all soft match systems as an
Lexical Retrieval Lexical retrieval is a score func- tion for token matching calculated between two high-dimensional sparse vectors with token weights. BM25 (Robertson et al., 2009) is the most commonly used lexical retrieval function. We use the BM25 results reported in Thakur et al. (2021b) for comparison.
7.1.2 Depth Considerations for Recall-Oriented Evaluation. All of our recall-oriented evaluations (e.g. lexirecall, RP, R1000) suffer when operating within a shallow retrieval environment. We rec- ommend that, especially for recall-oriented evaluation, retrieval depths be high, regardless of the specific evaluation method. Moreover, as labels become sparser, both RP and R1000 show sub- stantially more ties (Figure 12) and poor robustness (Figure 13). We recommend that, for shallow retrieval

Tishya Girdhar, a junior in neuroscience, is social chair for Fringe. She came to CMU wanting to drive, but first she had to get over being claustrophobic. She started as a mechanic and got behind the wheel for last year's Sweepstakes.

"Our team's philosophy is to teach everyone how to do everything," Girdhar said. "But I came to CMU wanting to drive. I wanted to drive so badly."
“Buggy doesn’t exist anywhere else. It’s a 100-year love of creation and collaboration,” said Olivia Keller at dawn on the inaugural morning practice — called first rolls — in late September. “That the alumni network can be so involved, that they continue to be passionate about buggy long after they’ve gone is very telling of how amazing and special buggy is. It’s part of the CMU experience,” said the senior chemical engineering major, pusher and chair of this year’s Kappa Kappa Gamma and Kappa
Fringe vehicles often are named with the letter "B," like Boson, Blueshift, Bissa and Bumper. Other teams, such as Apex, often use names that connotate fire, while the SDC (Student Dormitory Committee) team, uses names such as Vice, Bane, Avarice and Malice.

This year's buggy names will be under wraps until Thursday, when the Buggy Showcase will take place from noon to 2 p.m. in Weigand Gymnasium in the Cohon University Center. It's one of the few times spectators can see buggies up close.
