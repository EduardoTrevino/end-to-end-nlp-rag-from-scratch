Many existing speech translation benchmarks focus on native-English speech in high-quality recording conditions, which often do not match In this the conditions in real-life use-cases. paper, we describe our speech translation sys- tem for the multilingual track of IWSLT 2023, which evaluates translation quality on scientific conference talks. The test condition features accented input speech and terminology-dense contents. The task requires translation into 10 languages of varying amounts of

If you can ID any of the unknown buggies, let us know.

1949 – Design Competition (from the 1966 Buggy Book). Buggies are KapSig (far left), SAE’s design winner (#4, 2nd from the left), Men’s Dorms (#7, 3rd from the left), and DU (#11, far right).

1949 – SAE’s Design-winning buggy getting worked on (from the November 1949 issue of The Record, the SAE National Publication)

1949 – Citcom Clan Buggy (#9) (from the 1950 Thistle).
1948 – Barry Rowles (DTD Hill 5) works hard to get DTD (left) across the finish line first, edging out KapSig (right) for the trophy (from the 1949 Thistle). First “Broadcast”. 1948 is the first indication that we have of a “broadcast” on Raceday. According to the May 18, 1948 Tartan, a jeep patrolled the course and carried both the starter and a PA system, allowing the occupants of the vehicle to broadcast the race to the spectators on the course (as long as you were in range to hear the PA
