Question: In the paper titled "WebArena: A Realistic Web Environment for Building Autonomous Agents", what is the success rate of the best performing GPT-3.5 model?

Context: Paper title: 'WebArena: A Realistic Web Environment for Building Autonomous Agents' Published year: 2023 Publication venue or conference: arXiv.org Authors: Robert Lo, Frank F. Xu, Shuyan Zhou, Xuhui Zhou, Hao Zhu, Uri Alon, Daniel Fried, Abishek Sridhar, Graham Neubig, Yonatan Bisk, Xianyi Cheng Summary: This paper builds an environment for language-guided agents that is highly realistic and reproducible, and creates an environment with fully functional websites from four common domains:
We present WebArena, a highly-realistic, standalone, and reproducible web environment designed for the development and testing of autonomous agents. WebArena includes fully functional web applications and genuine data from four major categories, providing a realistic platform for agent interaction. It further supports a wide range of tools and external knowledge bases, fostering a focus on human-like problem-solving. Additionally, we curate a comprehensive benchmark consisting of 812 examples
Figure 1: WebArena is a standalone, self-hostable web environment for building autonomous agents. WebArena creates websites from four popular categories with functionality and data mimicking their real-world equivalents. To emulate human problem-solving, WebArena also embeds tools and knowledge resources as independent websites. WebArena introduces a benchmark on interpreting high-level realistic natural language command to concrete web-based interactions. We provide annotated programs designed

the 3 teams qualifying for Finals, broke the post-war record. In the finals, it was another close battle, with DTD squeaking it out over PiKA. DTD’s winning time of 2:42.5 was fast enough to set the course record, and PiKA’s 2:43.5 was only ½ second behind the prior record. SAE’s Best Design. SAE took home the trophy for Design Comp with their sleek aluminum buggy. Unfortunately, we haven’t found a photo. [Ed. Update: Based on the buggies from 1950, the 1950 Thistle’s actual description of
1946 – PiKA’s Buggy (from the 1947 Thistle). It didn’t win Design Competition, but it had the best aesthetic design. Prelim Heats and Results. The Prelims were run in 3 heats, with 3 teams in each. The rules initially stated that the winner of each heat would compete in the finals, but it seems that the rules changed to be the three fastest times instead, as the Prelim results printed in the May 7, 1946 Tartan indicate that the Finals was just a rematch of Prelim Heat 1. According to the May 7
After an hour-long argument with the judges (and presumably the Sweepstakes committee), the decision to DQ PiKA was upheld and DTD was awarded the victory. Final Time. The Tartan reported that DTD’s winning time was 3:49, but our database has the time as 2:49. 3:49 would be significantly slower than any other race on this course, but I also think it’s possible. Bleak skies threatened the race (meaning it may have been bad weather), the best Prelim time was 3:24.5, and DTD was the 2nd buggy to
14. Web search engines, 1994 The World Wide Web was still in its toddler stage when CMU researcher Michael “Fuzzy” Mauldin (CS’83,’89) developed one of the first successful search engines, Lycos. It was the most-visited site on the Web by 1999.
Innovation (MSAII) program is a successor to the M.S. in Biotechnology, Innovation and Computing (MSBIC). It combines a rigorous AI and machine learning curriculum with real-world team experience in identifying an AI market niche and developing a responsive product in cooperation with external stakeholders. The core program, which lasts four semesters and leads to a capstone project, focuses on both intrapreneurship and entrepreneurship, equipping graduates to either begin a startup or develop
