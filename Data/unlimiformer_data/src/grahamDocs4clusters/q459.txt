Abstract
This work unveils the enigmatic link between phonemes and facial features. Traditional studies on voice-face correla- tions typically involve using a long period of voice input, in- cluding generating face images from voices and reconstructing 3D face meshes from voices. However, in situations like voice- based crimes, the available voice evidence may be short and limited. Additionally, from a physiological perspective, each segment of speech - phoneme corresponds to different types of airflow

"Dave Singh explains how Fringe builds its buggies. Each team keeps its actual processes a secret, but each buggy has certain features such as a body, pushbar, wheels and driving and braking mechanisms. Behind Singh are other buggies built by Fringe."
If you can ID any of the unknown buggies, let us know.
