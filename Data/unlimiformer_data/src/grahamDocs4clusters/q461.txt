Question: In Prof. Fernando Diaz's paper on best-case retrieval evaluation, what is the name of the proposed metric for preference-based evaluation?

Context: 3.4 Best-Case Retrieval Evaluation Revisited In Section 3.1, we described two dimensions of uncertainty in re- trieval evaluation: recall level and psychological relevance. In both cases, we saw that the best-case utility was represented by RL1. In terms of preference-based evaluation, we would like to show

We address these issues by theoretically interpreting RL1 as a population-level metric we refer to as best-case retrieval evaluation. This allows us to propose a generalization of the RL1 ordering based on social choice theory [17] and preference-based evaluation [8]. This evaluation method, lexicographic precision or lexiprecision,

3.2 Lexicographic Precision The problem with evaluating for best-case retrieval (as shown in Section 2) is the tendency for multiple rankings to be tied, especially as (i) we increase the number of relevant items and (ii) systems optimize for retrieval metrics. We can address these ceiling effects by developing a best-case preference-based evaluation that focuses on measuring differences in performance instead of absolute per- formance [8]. While metric-based evaluation models the preference

the 3 teams qualifying for Finals, broke the post-war record. In the finals, it was another close battle, with DTD squeaking it out over PiKA. DTD’s winning time of 2:42.5 was fast enough to set the course record, and PiKA’s 2:43.5 was only ½ second behind the prior record. SAE’s Best Design. SAE took home the trophy for Design Comp with their sleek aluminum buggy. Unfortunately, we haven’t found a photo. [Ed.

Fringe vehicles often are named with the letter "B," like Boson, Blueshift, Bissa and Bumper. Other teams, such as Apex, often use names that connotate fire, while the SDC (Student Dormitory Committee) team, uses names such as Vice, Bane, Avarice and Malice.

This year's buggy names will be under wraps until Thursday, when the Buggy Showcase will take place from noon to 2 p.m. in Weigand Gymnasium in the Cohon University Center. It's one of the few times spectators can see buggies up close.
Tartan, Heat 1 saw a very tight race between KapSig, DTD, and PiKA, with KapSig winning in 3:24.5, DTD finishing in 3:25.1, and PiKA finishing in 3:26.3. Those were the top 3 times and they advanced to the finals. Prelim Heat 2 paired Beta, SAE, and DU, and SAE won the heat by default, as Beta was DQ’d for a pushbar violation and DU was DQ’d for a Hill 4-5 transition violation (the Tartan reports that they “shoved the buggy into the last zone instead of pushing it”). Prelims Heat 3 was a battle
