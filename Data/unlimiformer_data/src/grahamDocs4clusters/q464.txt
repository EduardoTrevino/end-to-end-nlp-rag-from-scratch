Question: What number do all of the CFA Interdisciplinary classes start with?

Context: 4Feature numbers start from 1. 5We report results for these two values as mild and severe cases of group bias. Our experiments with other values led to consistent results.

Finally, regarding the number of cluster cen- ters, following the Log-Jump method of Shen et al. (2022), we choose 490 and 6687 clusters for OPIEC59k and ReVerb45k, respectively.
Fig. 5 compares the confusion matrices obtained from six models. Each confusion matrix presents the number of true positives (TP), false positives (FP), false negatives (FN), and true negatives (TN) for binary classiﬁcation tasks. This study labels the classes ‘0’ for ‘Negative’ and ‘1’ for ‘Positive.’ The Switch Transformer model obtained the highest number of TP and TN, with 253 and 219, respectively. It misclassiﬁed 34 instances as false positives and 38 instances as false negatives.

First Non-Greek Orgs. 14 Organizations were entered for Raceday in 1948. They included all 12 fraternities (ATO, Beta, Beta Sigma Rho, DTD, DU, KapSig, PhiKap, PiKA, SAE, SigNu, Tau Delta Phi, and Theta Xi), the Men’s Dorms, and Citcom Clan (the commuters – “Citcom” is short for “CIT Commuter”). Although the Men’s Dorms were permitted to enter as far back as 1928, this is the first year that we have evidence that any organization other than a Greek actually did so. Training started in April,
Since the first Campus Week in 1920, when “chariots” were built to race around campus, student groups have been working year-round, using their engineering skills, design expertise and penchant for interdisciplinary collaboration to secretly build, modify and refine the most aerodynamic, torpedo-like vessel they call a “buggy.”
Déjà vu. Much like the prior years, the Tartan didn’t seem too interested with Buggy in 1949. So what we know is that 1949 seems very similar to 1948. Once again, 14 organizations (all 12 fraternities, Dorm Council and Citcom Clan) entered the race, and Prelims were run in 5 heats. The first 4 Heats had 3 buggies each, while the 5th Heat had only 2. Record-Breaking Year. There was little, if any, doubt that a course record would be broken this year. And in fact, each of DTD, PiKA, and KapSig,
complete 144 eligible units of study, including eight 12-unit courses, two 12-unit seminar courses and one 24-unit capstone course. Students must choose at minimum five core courses. The remainder of the 12-unit courses with course numbers 600 or greater can be electives chosen from the SCS course catalog. Any additional non-prerequisite units taken beyond the 144 units are also considered electives.
also complete at least one concentration, consisting of three courses in one of three areas: Analytics, Systems, or Human-Centered Data Science. The remaining elective course can be any course with number 600 or above chosen from the SCS course catalog. Any additional non-prerequisite units taken beyond the 144 units are also considered electives.  To maintain full-time enrollment status, a student must enroll in a minimum of 36 course units per semester.
An “SCS course” is any 12 -unit course with a course number indicating a unit of the

School of Computer Science (including LTI); a 6 -unit course with such a number counts

as 1/2 of an SCS course. Unless otherwise specified, "course" means an actual classroom

course, not credit given for research or independent study. Note: Recommended

electives that are technically outside  of the SCS now count towards this requirement; for
