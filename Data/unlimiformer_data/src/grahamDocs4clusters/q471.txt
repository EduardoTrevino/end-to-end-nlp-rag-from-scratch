Question: What does FACTORCL mean?

Context: 1. A new analysis of contrastive learning performance showing that standard multimodal CL fails to capture task-relevant unique information under low shared or high unique information cases.

2. A new contrastive learning algorithm called FACTORCL:

(a) FACTORCL factorizes task-relevant information into shared and unique information, expand-

ing contrastive learning to better handle low shared or high unique information.
contained in modality-unique regions: information that is only present in one modality but still relevant to the task. How can we learn self-supervised multimodal representations to capture both shared and unique information relevant to down- stream tasks? This paper proposes FACTORCL, a new multimodal representation learning method to go beyond multi-view redundancy. FACTORCL is built from three new contributions: (1) factorizing task-relevant information into shared and unique

Ma, R. Salakhutdinov, James Y. Zou, Zihao Deng Summary: FactorCL is a new multimodal representation learning method to go beyond multi-view redundancy and captures both shared and unique information and achieves state-of-the-art results on six benchmarks.

An “SCS course” is any 12 -unit course with a course number indicating a unit of the

School of Computer Science (including LTI); a 6 -unit course with such a number counts

as 1/2 of an SCS course. Unless otherwise specified, "course" means an actual classroom

course, not credit given for research or independent study. Note: Recommended

electives that are technically outside  of the SCS now count towards this requirement; for
