We evaluate both (1) intrinsic aspects of phonetic word embeddings, such as word retrieval and correlation with sound similarity, and (2) extrinsic performance on tasks such as rhyme and cognate detection and sound analogies. We hope our task suite will promote reproducibility and inspire future phonetic embedding research.
phonetic word embeddings, contain phonetic in- formation and have been of recent interest (Par- rish, 2017; Yang and Hirschberg, 2019; Hu et al., 2020; Sharma et al., 2021).1 The objective is that words with similar pronunciation should be mapped to vectors near each other in embedding space. Many tasks have benefited from incorpo- rating phonetic word embeddings, including cog- nate and loanword detection (Rama, 2016; Nath et al., 2022b,a), named entity recognition (Bharad- waj et al., 2016;

the 3 teams qualifying for Finals, broke the post-war record. In the finals, it was another close battle, with DTD squeaking it out over PiKA. DTD’s winning time of 2:42.5 was fast enough to set the course record, and PiKA’s 2:43.5 was only ½ second behind the prior record. SAE’s Best Design. SAE took home the trophy for Design Comp with their sleek aluminum buggy. Unfortunately, we haven’t found a photo. [Ed.

First “Broadcast”. 1948 is the first indication that we have of a “broadcast” on Raceday. According to the May 18, 1948 Tartan, a jeep patrolled the course and carried both the starter and a PA system, allowing the occupants of the vehicle to broadcast the race to the spectators on the course (as long as you were in range to hear the PA
