Question: What is the tldr of the paper Multimodal Fusion Interactions: A Study of Human and Automatic Quantification?

Context: Paper title: 'Multimodal Fusion Interactions: A Study of Human and Automatic Quantification' Published year: 2023 Publication venue or conference: International Conference on Multimodal Interaction Authors: Louis-Philippe Morency, R. Salakhutdinov, P. Liang, Yun Cheng Summary: A comparative study of how humans annotate two categorizations of multimodal interactions is performed and a method to automatically convert annotations of partial and counterfactual labels to information decomposition is
Results on multimodal fusion: We show full results on quantifying datasets in Table 6. For multimodal fusion, we find that different datasets do require different interactions. Among interesting observations are that (1) all pairs of modalities on sarcasm detection shows high synergy values, which aligns with intuition on sarcasm in human communication, (2) uniqueness values are strongly correlated with unimodal performance (e.g., AV-MNIST and MIMIC first modality), (3) datasets with high

Transition: Procedure whereby one pusher finishes pushing a buggy and the next pusher in sequence starts to push that same buggy.
Since the first Campus Week in 1920, when “chariots” were built to race around campus, student groups have been working year-round, using their engineering skills, design expertise and penchant for interdisciplinary collaboration to secretly build, modify and refine the most aerodynamic, torpedo-like vessel they call a “buggy.”
Beta’s new design was the winner of the first post-war Design Competition. The buggy, designed by Rick Saxton, was shaped like a bug with welded tubular steel. The real design battle seemed to be between Beta and PiKA, and the Tartan noted that PiKA’s buggy had a better appearance. However, Beta’s was structurally superior and that allowed it to take home the design trophy.
New departments, new areas of study Along the way, the Center for Machine Translation became the Language Technologies Institute, and other new departments were formed, including the Human-Computer Interaction Institute (1993), the Institute for Software Research (1999), the Machine Learning Department (2006) and the Ray and Stephanie Lane Center for Computational Biology (2009). SCS’s seven degree-granting departments draw faculty and students from a wide variety of disciplines, including
8. User interfaces, 1983 Why should humans adapt to fit computers? Shouldn’t computers adapt to fit humans? That was the attitude of CMU researchers, who applied design principles to computer science to develop better, easier-to-use interfaces. They called the new field “human-computer interaction.”
