Question: The first author of the paper Rethinking Voice-Face Correlation: A Geometry View is from which university?

Context: Yangjun Zhang, Pengjie Ren, Wentao Deng, Zhumin Chen, and Maarten Rijke. 2022. Improving multi- label malevolence detection in dialogues through multi-faceted label correlation enhancement. In Pro- ceedings of the 60th Annual Meeting of the Associa- tion for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), pages 3543–3555.
To investigate and understand the voice-face correlation at a more fine-grained phoneme level, we propose an anal- ysis pipeline that leverages a common feature extractor with a regression head to predict human anthropometric measure- ments (AM) from phoneme. Specifically, Human anthropomet- ric measurements are a set of facial measurements summarized from cognitive science studies that can effectively represent the identity of a human. We decompose the audio recordings into phonemes and learn

Ben Matzke is one such passionate alumnus. A 2011 mechanical engineering graduate, Matzke, former chair of the student group CIA (Carnegie Involvement Association), is chair of the Buggy Alumni Association's Centennial Planning Committee. He attended the first rolls to officially kick off the 100th anniversary season.
Tishya Girdhar, a junior in neuroscience, is social chair for Fringe. She came to CMU wanting to drive, but first she had to get over being claustrophobic. She started as a mechanic and got behind the wheel for last year's Sweepstakes.

"Our team's philosophy is to teach everyone how to do everything," Girdhar said. "But I came to CMU wanting to drive. I wanted to drive so badly."

First “Broadcast”. 1948 is the first indication that we have of a “broadcast” on Raceday. According to the May 18, 1948 Tartan, a jeep patrolled the course and carried both the starter and a PA system, allowing the occupants of the vehicle to broadcast the race to the spectators on the course (as long as you were in range to hear the PA

It was developed by future Turing Award winner and future SCS dean Raj Reddy along with his students. Their work on subsequent systems established many of the principles that still underlie speech recognition software.
