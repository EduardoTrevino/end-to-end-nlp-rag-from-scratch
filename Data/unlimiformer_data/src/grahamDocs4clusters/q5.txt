Question: What is the purpose of the ACL 60/60 evaluation sets?

Context: In the multilingual track, the testing condition is scientific conference talks. Therefore, we primarily rely on the ACL development (dev) set (Salesky et al., 2023) for validation. It consists of English transcripts of the talks and translations into the 10 target languages. The systems are then evaluated on a blind test set. The dev and test sets consist of 5 talks each. The paper abstracts for all talks are available in English. The talks are pre-segmented. In all experiments, we use the
Table 2: Automatic evaluation results on the ImageCode test set: We evaluate informativity using the retrieval ac- curacy of the ALBEF evaluative listener using captions generated by each approach. PICL substantially out- performs Base Speaker, Incre-RSA, Incre-RSA (PPL), and E-S (PPL), achieving a competitive level of infor- mativeness to E-S. In fluency, evaluated using GPT-2 perplexity, methods that control for the fluency (PPL) pivoting around PICL achieve similar level of perplexity, while
In order to assess the system’s capability to balance loads, we conduct experiments on running multi- ple sessions simultaneously using the same hosted model, with and without scaling the system’s num- ber of middleware workers. For speech processing, we test parallel sessions on ACL dev en-de using the end-to-end ST model. For text processing, we test one cascaded ST session on ACL dev where the number of parallel sessions is the number of requested MT languages. In all experiments, we set

Since the first Campus Week in 1920, when “chariots” were built to race around campus, student groups have been working year-round, using their engineering skills, design expertise and penchant for interdisciplinary collaboration to secretly build, modify and refine the most aerodynamic, torpedo-like vessel they call a “buggy.”
the 3 teams qualifying for Finals, broke the post-war record. In the finals, it was another close battle, with DTD squeaking it out over PiKA. DTD’s winning time of 2:42.5 was fast enough to set the course record, and PiKA’s 2:43.5 was only ½ second behind the prior record. SAE’s Best Design. SAE took home the trophy for Design Comp with their sleek aluminum buggy. Unfortunately, we haven’t found a photo. [Ed.
