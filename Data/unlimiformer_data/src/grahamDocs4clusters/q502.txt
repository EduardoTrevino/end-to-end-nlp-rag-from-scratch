Question: What is the end-to-end task success rate of the best GPT-4-based agent compared to human performance on the WebArena benchmark?

Context: that humans routinely perform on the internet. We experiment with several baseline agents, integrating recent techniques such as reasoning before acting. The results demonstrate that solving complex tasks is challenging: our best GPT-4-based agent only achieves an end-to-end task success rate of 14.41%, significantly lower than the human performance of 78.24%. These results highlight the need for further development of robust agents, that current state-of-the-art large language models are far
We use this benchmark to evaluate several agents that can follow NL command and perform web- based tasks (§4). These agents are implemented in a few-shot in-context learning fashion with powerful large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 and PALM-2. Experiment results show that the best GPT-4 agent performance is somewhat limited, with an end-to-end task success rate of only 14.41%, while the human performance is 78.24%. We hypothesize that the limited performance of current LLMs stems from a
that focus on translating high-level natural language intents into specific web interactions. We also offer metrics to programmatically ascertain whether tasks have been completed according to the desired objectives. Our experiments show that even GPT-4 only achieves a limited end-to-end task success rate of 14.41%, significantly lagging behind the human performance of 78.24%. These findings underscore the need for future research to focus on enhancing the robustness and efficacy of autonomous

After an hour-long argument with the judges (and presumably the Sweepstakes committee), the decision to DQ PiKA was upheld and DTD was awarded the victory. Final Time. The Tartan reported that DTD’s winning time was 3:49, but our database has the time as 2:49. 3:49 would be significantly slower than any other race on this course, but I also think it’s possible. Bleak skies threatened the race (meaning it may have been bad weather), the best Prelim time was 3:24.5, and DTD was the 2nd buggy to
Tartan, Heat 1 saw a very tight race between KapSig, DTD, and PiKA, with KapSig winning in 3:24.5, DTD finishing in 3:25.1, and PiKA finishing in 3:26.3. Those were the top 3 times and they advanced to the finals. Prelim Heat 2 paired Beta, SAE, and DU, and SAE won the heat by default, as Beta was DQ’d for a pushbar violation and DU was DQ’d for a Hill 4-5 transition violation (the Tartan reports that they “shoved the buggy into the last zone instead of pushing it”). Prelims Heat 3 was a battle
the 3 teams qualifying for Finals, broke the post-war record. In the finals, it was another close battle, with DTD squeaking it out over PiKA. DTD’s winning time of 2:42.5 was fast enough to set the course record, and PiKA’s 2:43.5 was only ½ second behind the prior record. SAE’s Best Design. SAE took home the trophy for Design Comp with their sleek aluminum buggy. Unfortunately, we haven’t found a photo. [Ed.
