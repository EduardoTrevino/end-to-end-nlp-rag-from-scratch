Question: What are the two proposed subtasks for the DSTC11 automatic evaluation track?

Context: This paper presents a comprehensive overview of Track 4 on "Robust and Multilingual Automatic Evaluation Metrics for Open-Domain Dialogue Systems" organized as part of the 11th Dialogue System Technology Challenge (DSTC11). The track was divided into two subtasks addressing an important problems in Dialogue Systems: the design of automatic evaluation metrics for multi- lingual dialogues and dialogue robustness when dealing with paraphrases or back-translations.
multiple domains and dimensions. Also, their focus is mainly on the English language. All of these challenges prompt the development of automatic evaluation metrics that are reliable in various domains, dimensions, and languages. This track in the 11th Dialogue System Technol- ogy Challenge (DSTC11) is part of the ongoing effort to promote robust and multilingual auto- matic evaluation metrics. This article describes the datasets and baselines provided to partici- pants and discusses the

1948 – Design Competition (from the 1949 Thistle). Identified buggies: KapSig (3rd from the left, back row); PiKA (4th from the left, back row); Beta Sigma Rho (far left, back row). We also believe that the bottom buggy in the front row (3 wheels, no shell) belongs to Citcom Clan.

1948 – Hill 1 of the Finals (from the 1949 Thistle). KapSig in Lane 1 (left), DTD in Lane 2 (middle), PiKA in Lane 3 (right)
Sweepstakes Committee: Jack Johnson (Chair)

Race Results: (1) DTD (2:42.5 – COURSE RECORD); (2) PiKA (2:43.5); (3) KapSig

Design Comp: (1) SAE; (Honorable Mention) PiKA

Weather: Sunny; 66-72 Degrees on Friday, 70-75 Degrees on Saturday

In 1949, DTD earned its second straight nose-length victory and set a course record in doing so. Other than that, the year seemed uneventful.
Tartan, Heat 1 saw a very tight race between KapSig, DTD, and PiKA, with KapSig winning in 3:24.5, DTD finishing in 3:25.1, and PiKA finishing in 3:26.3. Those were the top 3 times and they advanced to the finals. Prelim Heat 2 paired Beta, SAE, and DU, and SAE won the heat by default, as Beta was DQ’d for a pushbar violation and DU was DQ’d for a Hill 4-5 transition violation (the Tartan reports that they “shoved the buggy into the last zone instead of pushing it”). Prelims Heat 3 was a battle

10.7 End of Semester Evaluation

The MSAII program conducts an academic progress re view at the conclusion of each semester in

order to monitor individual student progress towa rds graduation. Should a student’s effort fall

below the acceptable level of academic perfor mance and/or fail to meet the standards
The MIIS degree is offered in  two options:

Option 1. Standard MIIS degree  (MIIS -16) - A 16 -month track that is completed in three

academic semesters (fall, spring, fall) and a summer internship.

Option 2. MIIS: Advanced Study degree  (MIIS -21) - A 21 -month track that is completed in

four academic semesters (fall, spring, fall, spring) and a summer internship.

MIIS: Advanced Study track offers in depth  degree in one of the following areas of

concentration:
