Developers who do not wish their source code to be used for training code LLMs are given the op- portunity to opt-out of The Stack (Kocetkov et al., 2022). We received 9 opt-out requests before the cut-off date for removing data (31 October 2022). These individuals accounted for 299 repositories. Of these, 161 were already excluded from The Stack v1.0 (because they did not have a permissive license), and 138 were in The Stack v1.0. We honored the requests to opt-out and removed these
repositories from The Stack v1.1. After the cut-off date (31 October 2022), we have received more requests for requests and we will remove these repositories prior to releasing The Stack v1.2.

The Finals, initially scheduled for 2pm on Saturday, May 4, were ultimately postponed until Saturday, May 11, due to a downpour that cast a damper on an otherwise exciting Spring Carnival. Controversial Finals. An overcast sky threatened rain on the makeup date as well, though it held off long enough for the race to be run. But some of the spectators may have wished the rain came sooner. Although signs were posted about the makeup date, cars ignored the notices and ended up blocking part of the
Fight Over Carnival Schedule. Now that Spring Carnival was back on, the students had to decide how they wanted it – As 2 days in May (losing a day of vacation) or one day in April (not sacrificing any other off days). Buggy was going to happen either way, but ultimately the students voted on a 2 day Carnival, keeping the tradition intact and putting Raceday on the schedule for May 2-3. Time Trials. It looks like this post-war period was when the race changed from a head-to-head to a time trial.
Delta Upsilon entered a three-wheeled buggy in 1940.

It’s quirky, it’s different, and it’s so Carnegie Mellon University, where the college experience is a little buggy.

Sweepstakes, better known as the Spring Carnival Buggy Races, will celebrate its 100th anniversary April 17-18, 2020. The CMU tradition is unlike any other.
