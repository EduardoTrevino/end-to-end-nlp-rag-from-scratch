Question: Is the GRE optional for the masters in language technologies application? Answer yes or no.

Context: has been shown to improve sequence modeling for tasks which naturally decompose into sub-tasks. Fi- nally, large language model decoders (e.g. mBART (Liu et al., 2020b)) can be adopted through an inte- gration with HuggingFace (Wolf et al., 2020).
Existing pretraining frameworks for language models fall into three categories: autoregressive, autoencod- ing, and encoder–decoder models. Most recent large language models, such as the GPT series [RWC+19, BMR+20, Ope23], LLaMA [TLI+23, TMS+23], BLOOM [SFA+23], and Falcon [AAA+23], are autore- gressive, using a left-to-right language model objective. Earlier models such as BERT [DCLT19], ELEC- TRA [CLLM20], and RoBERTa [LOG+19] are encoder-only, while BART [LLG+19] and T5 [RSR+20] are
including applications that adapt their design and functionality to the needs of different cultures (e.g., Oyibo, 2016; Reinecke and Bernstein, 2011, 2013). Similarly, language models could be made in more culturally adaptive ways, because one size does not fit all (Groenwold et al., 2020; Rettberg, 2022). Therefore, we urge the NLP community to value the adaptation of language technologies from one language or culture to another (Joshi et al., 2020).

Fairings have been a key feature for the Fringe team in recent years, which is celebrating its 50th anniversary of Buggy.

"We have a reputation of being the quietest on the course," said Diya Nuxoll, who wrapped up her bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering in December and is working on an advanced studies master's degree in design and manufacturing. Nuxoll leads the Fringe team as one of two head mechanics.
Q: Are there auditions? A: No, any member of the campus community with music experience is able to join the Kiltie Band!

Q: Do I have to memorize music? A: No, the music is changed for every show. You should invest in a good and trusty lyre.

Q: When is the first rehearsal? A: On the first day of class (Monday) at 5:30 p.m. in the CUC Studio Theater. If you have questions, please email the Direcator at jolisar@andrew.cmu.edu.
This year Fringe is planning to roll four different vehicles, built and maintained in the Fringe workshop in the basement of the East Campus Garage, known as the "Froom."

"We're used to saying everything with 'fr' in front of it but when we say something in front of other people, it gets them confused," said Fringe head mechanic Dave Singh, who will graduate in May with a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering and biomedical engineering.
