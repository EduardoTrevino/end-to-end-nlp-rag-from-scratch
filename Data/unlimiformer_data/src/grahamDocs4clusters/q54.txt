Question: According to the paper PROMPT2MODEL: Generating Deployable Models from Natural Language Instructions, what is the exact match achieved by gpt-3.5-turbo on the Squad dataset?

Context: the alignment-based matching to relevant labels may not be sufﬁciently effective. A natural rem- edy is to elaborate the input with a pre-trained GPT model to generate multiple pieces of texts. Speciﬁcally, we use a simple human instruction, "Elaborate the text with a few sentences," to guide the instruction-tuned GPT model, such as Alpaca- 7B (Taori et al., 2023), in generating probable ex- pansions and continuations of the text. Our sys- tem treats the concatenation of the input text and each
2 GPT-3 is one of most famous autoregressive English language models released. It was released by OpenAI in June 2020, after 355 compute years of training (on a V100). It consists of 175 billion param- eters and is particularly good at generating coherent and creative text. 3 Note how this is orthogonal to Gold (1967), arguing that grammar cannot be acquired from raw text: Even if language was subregular and learnable in the limit, meaning would not necessarily be learnable. Similarly, Gold

the 3 teams qualifying for Finals, broke the post-war record. In the finals, it was another close battle, with DTD squeaking it out over PiKA. DTD’s winning time of 2:42.5 was fast enough to set the course record, and PiKA’s 2:43.5 was only ½ second behind the prior record. SAE’s Best Design. SAE took home the trophy for Design Comp with their sleek aluminum buggy. Unfortunately, we haven’t found a photo. [Ed. Update: Based on the buggies from 1950, the 1950 Thistle’s actual description of
Tartan, Heat 1 saw a very tight race between KapSig, DTD, and PiKA, with KapSig winning in 3:24.5, DTD finishing in 3:25.1, and PiKA finishing in 3:26.3. Those were the top 3 times and they advanced to the finals. Prelim Heat 2 paired Beta, SAE, and DU, and SAE won the heat by default, as Beta was DQ’d for a pushbar violation and DU was DQ’d for a Hill 4-5 transition violation (the Tartan reports that they “shoved the buggy into the last zone instead of pushing it”). Prelims Heat 3 was a battle
1946 – PiKA’s Buggy (from the 1947 Thistle). It didn’t win Design Competition, but it had the best aesthetic design. Prelim Heats and Results. The Prelims were run in 3 heats, with 3 teams in each. The rules initially stated that the winner of each heat would compete in the finals, but it seems that the rules changed to be the three fastest times instead, as the Prelim results printed in the May 7, 1946 Tartan indicate that the Finals was just a rematch of Prelim Heat 1.
