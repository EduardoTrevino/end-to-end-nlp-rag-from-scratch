Question: In fall 2023, When is the deadline to drop a Mini-1 course with a withdrawal grade assigned?

Context: Developers who do not wish their source code to be used for training code LLMs are given the op- portunity to opt-out of The Stack (Kocetkov et al., 2022). We received 9 opt-out requests before the cut-off date for removing data (31 October 2022). These individuals accounted for 299 repositories. Of these, 161 were already excluded from The Stack v1.0 (because they did not have a permissive license), and 138 were in The Stack v1.0. We honored the requests to opt-out and removed these
repositories from The Stack v1.1. After the cut-off date (31 October 2022), we have received more requests for requests and we will remove these repositories prior to releasing The Stack v1.2.
Mini GPT-4 [Zhu et al., 2023] uses a pretrained Q-Former module from [Li et al., 2023] to project images encoded by EVA CLIP ViT-G/14 [Fang et al., 2022] to Vicuna’s [Chiang et al., 2023] text embedding space. Both CLIP and Vicuna are frozen, while a section of the Q-former is finetuned on a subset of LAION [Schuhmann et al., 2021], Conceptual Captions [Sharma et al., 2018], SBU [Ordonez et al., 2011], and multimodal instruction-following data generated by the authors.

The Finals, initially scheduled for 2pm on Saturday, May 4, were ultimately postponed until Saturday, May 11, due to a downpour that cast a damper on an otherwise exciting Spring Carnival. Controversial Finals. An overcast sky threatened rain on the makeup date as well, though it held off long enough for the race to be run. But some of the spectators may have wished the rain came sooner. Although signs were posted about the makeup date, cars ignored the notices and ended up blocking part of the
Fight Over Carnival Schedule. Now that Spring Carnival was back on, the students had to decide how they wanted it – As 2 days in May (losing a day of vacation) or one day in April (not sacrificing any other off days). Buggy was going to happen either way, but ultimately the students voted on a 2 day Carnival, keeping the tradition intact and putting Raceday on the schedule for May 2-3. Time Trials. It looks like this post-war period was when the race changed from a head-to-head to a time trial.
The streets of the race course haven't changed, but the condition of the course varies due to potholes, which can make or break a fast run. The last course records were set in 2017, but this year potholes are making for some challenging conditions, said Amy Chen, a senior in psychology who has been driving for four years.

With the vehicles just inches from the ground, "even poorly filled potholes makes it dangerous to drive," she added.
