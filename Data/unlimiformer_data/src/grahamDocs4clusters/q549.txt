Question: How does using random walks to estimate entity centrality on conversation entity graphs affect answer passage ranking?

Context: Paper title: 'Conversational Search with Random Walks over Entity Graphs' Published year: 2023 Publication venue or conference: International Conference on the Theory of Information Retrieval Authors: Gustavo Gonçalves, Jamie Callan, João Magalhães Summary: Experiments show that using random walks to estimate entity centrality on conversation entity graphs improves top precision answer passage ranking over competitive transformer-based baselines.
Izac- ard et al. (2021) and Wu et al. (2020) to construct examples for single retrieval and entity linking, re- spectively. For single retrieval, a pair of randomly cropped views of a passage is used as a positive
pseudo query. Then, in each sampled passage, we randomly pick an anchor entity and take the first passage of its associated Wikipedia page as the tar- get. To avoid redundancy, if an anchor entity has been used 10 times in a source page, we no longer pick it for the given source. If the query and the target together exceed 512 tokens, we will truncate the longer of the two by randomly dropping its first token or its last token.

and the organizations snuck out at midnight to get some practice on the course. Avoiding Controversies. After the controversy of 1947 (which, sadly and as noted above, we don’t have details of), Sweepstakes decided to tighten up the rules to avoid any confusion for Raceday. Of course, we don’t have the rules that were tightened either. We’ll keep digging, and if we find it out, we’ll update this post. On the plus side, 1948 didn’t appear to have any controversies. Prelim Results. Raceday itself
Déjà vu. Much like the prior years, the Tartan didn’t seem too interested with Buggy in 1949. So what we know is that 1949 seems very similar to 1948. Once again, 14 organizations (all 12 fraternities, Dorm Council and Citcom Clan) entered the race, and Prelims were run in 5 heats. The first 4 Heats had 3 buggies each, while the 5th Heat had only 2. Record-Breaking Year. There was little, if any, doubt that a course record would be broken this year. And in fact, each of DTD, PiKA, and KapSig,
out how many pedestrians they had hit”). The impact was severe enough that KapSig’s buggy was dented, and the time it lost from the impact made it impossible for them to catch up. PiKA eventually passed DTD in the freeroll and went on to win by 30 yards, but by then it didn’t matter. The judges decided to DQ PiKA for interference. The brothers of PiKA didn’t take it lightly though; they immediately lodged a protest against the judge’s decision.
