Question: According to authors of the FLARE paper, what is one limitation of existing retrieval augmented LMs?

Context: Due to the emerging real-world demands and the limitations of black-box APIs, fine-tuning retrieval-augmented LM for each possible down- stream task can be infeasible. Hence, we intro- duce Augmentation-Adapted Retriever (AAR) as a generic plug-in for black-box LMs. As illustrated in Figure 2, AAR can learn the preferences of LMs without the need for fine-tuning them.
Existing passive multi-time retrieval augmented LMs can also be formulated using our framework (subsection 2.3). In this section, we formally in- troduce three baseline categories based on when and what to retrieve. These baselines are not exact reproductions of the corresponding paper because many design choices differ which makes direct comparisons impossible. We implemented them using the same settings, with the only variation being when and what to retrieve.
they lack the required knowledge to avoid unneces- sary or inappropriate retrieval that occurs in passive retrieval augmented LMs (Khandelwal et al., 2020; Borgeaud et al., 2022; Ram et al., 2023; Trivedi et al., 2022). Given the observation that large LMs tend to be well-calibrated and low probability/con- fidence often indicates a lack of knowledge (Ka- davath et al., 2022), we adopt an active retrieval strategy that only retrieves when LMs generate low- probability tokens.

front hills, causing more congestion for spectators on those hills. A police tow truck was present, but it was not permitted to clear the street. Up the front hills, DTD was in the lead, followed by PiKA and KapSig. DTD went into the freerolls first, but the drama was behind them. As PiKA entered the freeroll, PiKA’s buggy crowded KapSig’s buggy and forced KapSig wide, causing KapSig to swerve and hit at least 1 spectator (the Tartan says that KapSig “got out pencil and paper to try to figure
The Finals, initially scheduled for 2pm on Saturday, May 4, were ultimately postponed until Saturday, May 11, due to a downpour that cast a damper on an otherwise exciting Spring Carnival. Controversial Finals. An overcast sky threatened rain on the makeup date as well, though it held off long enough for the race to be run. But some of the spectators may have wished the rain came sooner. Although signs were posted about the makeup date, cars ignored the notices and ended up blocking part of the
