Question: FLARE method from Jiang et al., was evaluated on four knowledge-intensive tasks. What are these tasks?

Context: We evaluate the effectiveness of FLARE on 4 di- verse knowledge-intensive tasks using few-shot in- context learning (Radford et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2023). We follow previous works (Trivedi et al., 2022) to sub-sample at most 500 examples from each dataset due to the cost of run- ning experiments. Datasets, metrics, and settings are summarized in Table 7 of Appendix B. The hyperparameters of FLARE are selected based on the development set and listed in Table 9. FLARE
sidering the impressive performance achieved by GPT-3.5 (Ouyang et al., 2022) on a variety of tasks, we examine the effectiveness of our meth- ods on text-davinci-003. We evaluate FLARE on 4 diverse tasks/datasets involving generating long outputs, including multihop QA (2WikiMul- tihopQA), commonsense reasoning (StrategyQA), long-form QA (ASQA), and open-domain summa- rization (WikiAsp) (Ho et al., 2020; Geva et al., 2021; Stelmakh et al., 2022; Hayashi et al., 2021). Over all tasks, FLARE
relevant doc- uments to regenerate the sentence if it contains low-confidence tokens. We test FLARE along with baselines comprehensively over 4 long- form knowledge-intensive generation tasks/- datasets. FLARE achieves superior or compet- itive performance on all tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method.1

This year Fringe is planning to roll four different vehicles, built and maintained in the Fringe workshop in the basement of the East Campus Garage, known as the "Froom."

"We're used to saying everything with 'fr' in front of it but when we say something in front of other people, it gets them confused," said Fringe head mechanic Dave Singh, who will graduate in May with a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering and biomedical engineering.
Since the first Campus Week in 1920, when “chariots” were built to race around campus, student groups have been working year-round, using their engineering skills, design expertise and penchant for interdisciplinary collaboration to secretly build, modify and refine the most aerodynamic, torpedo-like vessel they call a “buggy.”
In the spring, the Task Force partnered with SME Branding — a firm with more than 17 years of experience creating mascots for professional sports teams and universities — to develop the graphics for the mascot. During October, students and alumni reviewed potential mascot images in focus groups.
