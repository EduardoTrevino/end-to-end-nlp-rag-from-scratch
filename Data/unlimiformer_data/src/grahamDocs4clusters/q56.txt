Question: By whom was Kevlar fiber invented?

Context: The Harary-Ross algorithm has ﬂaws, as reported by Harary in his 1969 text, “Graph Theory” [23]. Instead of using that algorithm, I used a more modern one, the Tomita variant of the Bron-Kerbosch algorithm. In 1967, Edward Bierstone and Allen Bernholtz developed a semilattice recomposition program described in their report “HIDECS-RECOMP PROCEDURE” [19]. I coded it up to visualize the produced decompositions. Rather than trying to describe the algorithm, I’ll quote Bierstone and Bernholtz:

ACT-R, short for Adaptive Control of Thought-Rational, is developed primarily by John An- derson’s research group in the CMU Department of Psychology [1, 2]. It is another cognitive architecture that aims to model and explain the mental processes that are central to human cog- nition. The key assumption in ACT-R is that there are two kinds of knowledge: declarative knowledge and procedural knowledge. Declarative knowledge is represented as “chunks,” struc- tures with an isa pointer to what kind

Beta’s new design was the winner of the first post-war Design Competition. The buggy, designed by Rick Saxton, was shaped like a bug with welded tubular steel. The real design battle seemed to be between Beta and PiKA, and the Tartan noted that PiKA’s buggy had a better appearance. However, Beta’s was structurally superior and that allowed it to take home the design trophy.

It was developed by future Turing Award winner and future SCS dean Raj Reddy along with his students. Their work on subsequent systems established many of the principles that still underlie speech recognition software.
