Question: On which benchmarks did the authors test FiT5's performance?

Context: Experimental results on widely-used IR bench- marks, namely MS MARCO (Nguyen et al., 2016) and TREC DL 2019 (Craswell et al., 2020) & 2020 (Craswell et al., 2021), demonstrate that FiT5 exhibits substantial improvements over traditional retrieve-and-rerank pipelines. Furthermore, FiT5 outperforms systems with more re-ranking stages and/or larger models on the MS MARCO dataset. Further analysis reveals that FiT5 effectively lever- ages ranking features through its global attention architecture,
Baselines We compare FiT5 with typical two- stage retrieve-and-rerank pipelines including BERT Re-ranker (Nogueira and Cho, 2019) and monoT5 (Nogueira et al., 2020). These re-rankers simply assign a score for a (q, di) text pair. To have a fair comparison, the first-stage retrieval for such pipelines is kept the same as FiT5. We also report the performance of three-stage ranking pipelines HLATR (Zhang et al., 2022) and Expando-Mono- Duo (Pradeep et al., 2021) for reference.
Table 2: Ablation study of FiT5. The evaluation metric is MRR@10 on MS MARCO and NDCG@10 on TREC DL.

If you can ID any of the unknown buggies, let us know.

1949 – Design Competition (from the 1966 Buggy Book). Buggies are KapSig (far left), SAE’s design winner (#4, 2nd from the left), Men’s Dorms (#7, 3rd from the left), and DU (#11, far right).

1949 – SAE’s Design-winning buggy getting worked on (from the November 1949 issue of The Record, the SAE National Publication)

1949 – Citcom Clan Buggy (#9) (from the 1950 Thistle).
Beta’s new design was the winner of the first post-war Design Competition. The buggy, designed by Rick Saxton, was shaped like a bug with welded tubular steel. The real design battle seemed to be between Beta and PiKA, and the Tartan noted that PiKA’s buggy had a better appearance. However, Beta’s was structurally superior and that allowed it to take home the design trophy.
the 3 teams qualifying for Finals, broke the post-war record. In the finals, it was another close battle, with DTD squeaking it out over PiKA. DTD’s winning time of 2:42.5 was fast enough to set the course record, and PiKA’s 2:43.5 was only ½ second behind the prior record. SAE’s Best Design. SAE took home the trophy for Design Comp with their sleek aluminum buggy. Unfortunately, we haven’t found a photo. [Ed. Update: Based on the buggies from 1950, the 1950 Thistle’s actual description of
8. User interfaces, 1983 Why should humans adapt to fit computers? Shouldn’t computers adapt to fit humans? That was the attitude of CMU researchers, who applied design principles to computer science to develop better, easier-to-use interfaces. They called the new field “human-computer interaction.”
15. Model checking, 1994 CMU professor Edmund Clarke had long stressed the importance of verifying computer hardware and software through a formal problem-solving technique called “model checking.” In 1994, his arguments gained new weight with the discovery that Intel’s amazing new Pentium chip made errors on certain math problems. Clarke would go on to receive the Turing Award for his role in the development of model checking.
