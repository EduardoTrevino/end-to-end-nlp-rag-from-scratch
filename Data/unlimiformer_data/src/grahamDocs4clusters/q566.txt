Question: Who is ther first author of the paper Cross-Modal Fine-Tuning: Align then Refine?

Context: Starting from the LLaMA-2-70b base language model (Touvron et al., 2023b), Dromedary-2 is first Supervised Fine-Tuned (SFT) with the bootstrapping data generated by an improved version4 of SELF-ALIGN with 6 In-Context Learning exemplars (Sun et al., 2023b). Following this, a Rein- forcement Learning (RL) fine-tuning stage is conducted employing the SALMON paradigm. Our endeavor aims at advancing the frontier of AI alignment when minimizing the requisite for human oversight. In this work, the
Paper title: 'One-for-All: Generalized LoRA for Parameter-Efficient Fine-tuning' Published year: 2023 Publication venue or conference: arXiv.org Authors: Eric P. Xing, Arnav Chavan, Zhuang Liu, Zhiqiang Shen, D. Gupta Summary: Generalized LoRA is presented, an advanced approach for universal parameter-efficient fine-tuning tasks, which outperforms all previous methods in natural, specialized, and structured vision benchmarks, achieving superior accuracy with fewer parameters and computations.

Since the first Campus Week in 1920, when “chariots” were built to race around campus, student groups have been working year-round, using their engineering skills, design expertise and penchant for interdisciplinary collaboration to secretly build, modify and refine the most aerodynamic, torpedo-like vessel they call a “buggy.”
Ben Matzke is one such passionate alumnus. A 2011 mechanical engineering graduate, Matzke, former chair of the student group CIA (Carnegie Involvement Association), is chair of the Buggy Alumni Association's Centennial Planning Committee. He attended the first rolls to officially kick off the 100th anniversary season.
1948 – Barry Rowles (DTD Hill 5) works hard to get DTD (left) across the finish line first, edging out KapSig (right) for the trophy (from the 1949 Thistle). First “Broadcast”. 1948 is the first indication that we have of a “broadcast” on Raceday. According to the May 18, 1948 Tartan, a jeep patrolled the course and carried both the starter and a PA system, allowing the occupants of the vehicle to broadcast the race to the spectators on the course (as long as you were in range to hear the PA

Those lessons served Gosling well when he developed Java, the first programming language able to run on almost any platform.
