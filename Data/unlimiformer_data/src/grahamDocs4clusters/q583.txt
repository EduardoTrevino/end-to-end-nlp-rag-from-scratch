Question: The MOSAIC framework from the paper titled "MOSAIC: Learning Unified Multi-Sensory Object Property Representations for Robot Perception" was evaluated on two task families. What are these task families?

Context: Paper title: 'MOSAIC: Learning Unified Multi-Sensory Object Property Representations for Robot Perception' Published year: 2023 Publication venue or conference: arXiv.org Authors: Yonatan Bisk, Jonathan M Francis, Gyan Tatiya, Ho-Hsiang Wu, J. Sinapov Summary: This work pioneers the application of CLIP-based sensory grounding in robotics, promising a significant leap in multi-sensory perception capabilities for autonomous systems.
aligning these rep- resentations not only across vision but also haptic and auditory sensory modalities. Through extensive experiments on a dataset where a humanoid robot interacts with 100 objects across 10 exploratory behaviors, we demonstrate the versatility of MOSAIC in two task families: object categorization and object- fetching tasks. Our results underscore the efficacy of MOSAIC’s unified representations, showing competitive performance in category recognition through a simple linear
We introduced the MOSAIC framework to enable robots to generate versatile, multimodal representations through interactive object perception and to leverage these unified representations across various downstream robot learning tasks. Through extensive performance evaluation, we have showcased the effectiveness of these unified representations in tasks such as category recognition, using a simple linear probe setup, and the fetch object task under zero-shot condi- tions. Moving forward, there

In the spring, the Task Force partnered with SME Branding — a firm with more than 17 years of experience creating mascots for professional sports teams and universities — to develop the graphics for the mascot. During October, students and alumni reviewed potential mascot images in focus groups.
Fairings have been a key feature for the Fringe team in recent years, which is celebrating its 50th anniversary of Buggy.

"We have a reputation of being the quietest on the course," said Diya Nuxoll, who wrapped up her bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering in December and is working on an advanced studies master's degree in design and manufacturing. Nuxoll leads the Fringe team as one of two head mechanics.
