Context: Paper title: 'WebArena: A Realistic Web Environment for Building Autonomous Agents' Published year: 2023 Publication venue or conference: arXiv.org Authors: Robert Lo, Frank F. Xu, Shuyan Zhou, Xuhui Zhou, Hao Zhu, Uri Alon, Daniel Fried, Abishek Sridhar, Graham Neubig, Yonatan Bisk, Xianyi Cheng Summary: This paper builds an environment for language-guided agents that is highly realistic and reproducible, and creates an environment with fully functional websites from four common domains:
(1) Information-seeking tasks expect a textual response. Importantly, these tasks in WebArena often require navigation across multiple pages or focus on user-centric content. This makes them distinct from open-domain question-answering (Yang et al., 2018; Kwiatkowski et al., 2019), which focuses on querying general knowledge with a simple retrieval step. For instance, to answer “When was the last time I bought the shampoo”, an agent traverses the user’s purchase history, checking order details
such as map, calculator, and scratchpad, to best support possible human-like task executions. Lastly, WebArena is complemented by an extensive collection of documentation and knowledge bases that vary from general resources like English Wikipedia to more domain-specific references, such as manuals for using the integrated development tool (Fan et al., 2022). The content populating these websites is extracted from their real-world counterparts, preserving the authenticity of the content served

The streets of the race course haven't changed, but the condition of the course varies due to potholes, which can make or break a fast run. The last course records were set in 2017, but this year potholes are making for some challenging conditions, said Amy Chen, a senior in psychology who has been driving for four years.

With the vehicles just inches from the ground, "even poorly filled potholes makes it dangerous to drive," she added.

Tishya Girdhar, a junior in neuroscience, is social chair for Fringe. She came to CMU wanting to drive, but first she had to get over being claustrophobic. She started as a mechanic and got behind the wheel for last year's Sweepstakes.

"Our team's philosophy is to teach everyone how to do everything," Girdhar said. "But I came to CMU wanting to drive. I wanted to drive so badly."
