Question: What are the course number(s) for the courses on LLMs?

Context: Math Reasoning The prompts for the Base LLM are sourced from PaL (Gao et al., 2022) as ⟨xi, yi⟩. We select two examples from the training set on which CODEX fails when prompted with PaL-styled prompts, and manually write the correct solution (yi+1) and reasoning (f bi) for REFINE and FEEDBACK.
instruction prompt p(u, i), e.g., “how would user 1234 rate item 5678”, such that LLM can understand this task. Af- ter feeding p(u, i) into the LLM, it can generate a numerical string in the scale of 1 to 5 such as “4.12”, indicating that the user is likely to interact with the item.
74.8 ±0.0 90.7 ±0.0 77.7 ±0.0 91.5 ±0.0 77.2 ±0.0 91.9 ±0.0

70.8 ±0.0 88.6 ±0.0

Table 3: We compare the effect of LLM intervention without demonstrations or without instructions. We see that GPT-3.5-based Keyphrase Clustering outperforms instruction-finetuned encoders of different sizes, even when we provide the same prompt.

Safety is a top priority for teams. All drivers are required to have five pieces of safety gear: mouth guard, goggles, a harness that includes three points of contact to the body of the buggy, gloves and a helmet. And during practice runs and races, flaggers man the course to let drivers know if it's safe to proceed.
Déjà vu. Much like the prior years, the Tartan didn’t seem too interested with Buggy in 1949. So what we know is that 1949 seems very similar to 1948. Once again, 14 organizations (all 12 fraternities, Dorm Council and Citcom Clan) entered the race, and Prelims were run in 5 heats. The first 4 Heats had 3 buggies each, while the 5th Heat had only 2. Record-Breaking Year. There was little, if any, doubt that a course record would be broken this year. And in fact, each of DTD, PiKA, and KapSig,

complete 144 eligible units of study, including eight 12-unit courses, two 12-unit seminar courses and one 24-unit capstone course. Students must choose at minimum five core courses. The remainder of the 12-unit courses with course numbers 600 or greater can be electives chosen from the SCS course catalog. Any additional non-prerequisite units taken beyond the 144 units are also considered electives.
An “SCS course” is any 12 -unit course with a course number indicating a unit of the

School of Computer Science (including LTI); a 6 -unit course with such a number counts

as 1/2 of an SCS course. Unless otherwise specified, "course" means an actual classroom

course, not credit given for research or independent study. Note: Recommended

electives that are technically outside  of the SCS now count towards this requirement; for
also complete at least one concentration, consisting of three courses in one of three areas: Analytics, Systems, or Human-Centered Data Science. The remaining elective course can be any course with number 600 or above chosen from the SCS course catalog. Any additional non-prerequisite units taken beyond the 144 units are also considered electives.  To maintain full-time enrollment status, a student must enroll in a minimum of 36 course units per semester.
