Question: In the KALE lexical expansion paper, what three datasets are evaluated?

Context: Paper title: 'KALE: Using a K-Sparse Projector for Lexical Expansion' Published year: 2023 Publication venue or conference: International Conference on the Theory of Information Retrieval Authors: Bruno Martins, Jamie Callan, Luís Borges Summary: KALE is a new lightweight method that uses a small model with a k-sparse projector to convert dense representations into a sparse set of entries from a latent vocabulary, which can replace the original lexical vocabulary with gains in accuracy and
Evaluating Domain Generalization We evaluate on the union of two question-answering benchmarks: Machine Reading for Question Answering (MRQA) (Fisch et al., 2019) and UnifiedQA (Khashabi et al., 2020), which together consist of 30 unique QA datasets. These QA datasets span a range of domains, allowing us to measure the impact of topic alignment (see Table 9).
4.5 Dataset Statistics To this end, we automatically compile a dataset with event hierarchies of maximum height=3 that consists of 2K events and 937K across 42 languages. The detailed statistics of the train-dev-test split as well as the Wikinews evaluation set (WN) are presented in Table 1. Other than the events within hierarchies, we use the full set of events (including single- tons) as the pool of candidates, this expands the effective size of our event dictionary to nearly 13k.

Tartan, Heat 1 saw a very tight race between KapSig, DTD, and PiKA, with KapSig winning in 3:24.5, DTD finishing in 3:25.1, and PiKA finishing in 3:26.3. Those were the top 3 times and they advanced to the finals. Prelim Heat 2 paired Beta, SAE, and DU, and SAE won the heat by default, as Beta was DQ’d for a pushbar violation and DU was DQ’d for a Hill 4-5 transition violation (the Tartan reports that they “shoved the buggy into the last zone instead of pushing it”). Prelims Heat 3 was a battle
1948 – Design Competition (from the 1949 Thistle). Identified buggies: KapSig (3rd from the left, back row); PiKA (4th from the left, back row); Beta Sigma Rho (far left, back row). We also believe that the bottom buggy in the front row (3 wheels, no shell) belongs to Citcom Clan.

1948 – Hill 1 of the Finals (from the 1949 Thistle). KapSig in Lane 1 (left), DTD in Lane 2 (middle), PiKA in Lane 3 (right)
Déjà vu. Much like the prior years, the Tartan didn’t seem too interested with Buggy in 1949. So what we know is that 1949 seems very similar to 1948. Once again, 14 organizations (all 12 fraternities, Dorm Council and Citcom Clan) entered the race, and Prelims were run in 5 heats. The first 4 Heats had 3 buggies each, while the 5th Heat had only 2. Record-Breaking Year. There was little, if any, doubt that a course record would be broken this year. And in fact, each of DTD, PiKA, and KapSig,

MCDS Program Learning Outcomes

Design, implement and evaluate the use of analytic algorithms on sample datasets.

Explain how a machine

learning model is developed for and evaluated on real world datasets.
3.3.6.3 Areas of Concentration In addition to the common MCDS core, all students must complete at least one area of concentration, which consists of three courses in Analytics, Systems, or Human- Centered Data Science. Students consult with their academic advisor and choose one or more areas of concentration during their first semester, in preparation for enrolling in Spring classes.
