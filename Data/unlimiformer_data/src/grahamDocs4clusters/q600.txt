Question: How does SenteCon affect predictive performance on downstream tasks?

Context: We evaluate the implications of SENTECON(+) on downstream predictive performance. Our results, including comparisons with baseline models, are shown in Tables 1 and 2. Importantly, we find that: (1) Both SENTECON and SENTECON+ per- form better than the Lexicon and Lexi- con+word2vec approaches do on downstream tasks (Table 1). This finding suggests that by mod- eling sentence-level context, SENTECON and SEN- TECON+ improve text characterization with respect to not only human evaluation but also
text, and we ran a series of experiments using SEN- TECON in downstream predictive tasks. In doing so, we demonstrated that SENTECON and its exten- sion, SENTECON+, better represent the character and content of the text than traditional lexicons do. Furthermore, we showed that when used in con- junction with language models fine-tuned on the downstream task, SENTECON and SENTECON+ provide interpretability to deep language models without any loss of performance. These findings render SENTECON
representations. Given a passage of text, SENTECON encodes the text as a layer of interpretable categories in which each dimension corresponds to the rele- vance of a specific category. Our empirical eval- uations indicate that encoding language with SENTECON provides high-level interpretability at little to no cost to predictive performance on downstream tasks. Moreover, we find that SENTECON outperforms existing interpretable language representations with respect to both its downstream

out how many pedestrians they had hit”). The impact was severe enough that KapSig’s buggy was dented, and the time it lost from the impact made it impossible for them to catch up. PiKA eventually passed DTD in the freeroll and went on to win by 30 yards, but by then it didn’t matter. The judges decided to DQ PiKA for interference. The brothers of PiKA didn’t take it lightly though; they immediately lodged a protest against the judge’s decision.
front hills, causing more congestion for spectators on those hills. A police tow truck was present, but it was not permitted to clear the street. Up the front hills, DTD was in the lead, followed by PiKA and KapSig. DTD went into the freerolls first, but the drama was behind them. As PiKA entered the freeroll, PiKA’s buggy crowded KapSig’s buggy and forced KapSig wide, causing KapSig to swerve and hit at least 1 spectator (the Tartan says that KapSig “got out pencil and paper to try to figure
We don’t have many details of the race itself, but DTD took the win, just barely edging out KapSig, who was less than 1 second behind. DTD’s goggled driver was Dick Stanley, and the Hill 5 pusher working very hard was Barry Rowles. As a consolation prize, KapSig’s streamlined aluminum buggy (which looks just like a slightly larger version of today’s designs, with an extra wheel) took home the Design Comp trophy.
