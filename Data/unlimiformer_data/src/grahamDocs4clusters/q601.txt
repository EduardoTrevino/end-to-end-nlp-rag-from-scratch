Language
Existing research classiﬁes world languages into Resource 0 to 5, with 0 having the lowest resource and 5 having the highest (Joshi et al., 2020). We choose 10 target languages ranging from Resource 0 to 5 (Table 2). For each target language we choose ten neighboring languages as source lan- guages (Table 2). We prioritize Resource 0 to 2 languages as real endangered languages, and we use Resource 3 to 5 languages as hypothetical ones. To translate into these languages, our text is the Bible in

Introduction

Despite the majority of the world’s languages be- ing low-resource, current MT systems still perform poorly on them or do not include them at all. Some commercial systems like Google Translate1 sup- port a number of LRLs, but many systems do not support any, and in either case the majority of LRLs are largely neglected in language technologies.

1948 – Design Competition (from the 1949 Thistle). Identified buggies: KapSig (3rd from the left, back row); PiKA (4th from the left, back row); Beta Sigma Rho (far left, back row). We also believe that the bottom buggy in the front row (3 wheels, no shell) belongs to Citcom Clan.

1948 – Hill 1 of the Finals (from the 1949 Thistle). KapSig in Lane 1 (left), DTD in Lane 2 (middle), PiKA in Lane 3 (right)
Fringe vehicles often are named with the letter "B," like Boson, Blueshift, Bissa and Bumper. Other teams, such as Apex, often use names that connotate fire, while the SDC (Student Dormitory Committee) team, uses names such as Vice, Bane, Avarice and Malice.

This year's buggy names will be under wraps until Thursday, when the Buggy Showcase will take place from noon to 2 p.m. in Weigand Gymnasium in the Cohon University Center. It's one of the few times spectators can see buggies up close.
First Non-Greek Orgs. 14 Organizations were entered for Raceday in 1948. They included all 12 fraternities (ATO, Beta, Beta Sigma Rho, DTD, DU, KapSig, PhiKap, PiKA, SAE, SigNu, Tau Delta Phi, and Theta Xi), the Men’s Dorms, and Citcom Clan (the commuters – “Citcom” is short for “CIT Commuter”). Although the Men’s Dorms were permitted to enter as far back as 1928, this is the first year that we have evidence that any organization other than a Greek actually did so. Training started in April,
