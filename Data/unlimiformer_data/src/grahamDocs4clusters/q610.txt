These and other methods have been programed for the IBM 7090, and are de- scribed in full elsewhere [3, 16]. It is important, and rather surprising, that the techniques do not suﬀer from the sampling diﬃculties often found in hill-climbing procedures, but gives extremely stable optima even for short computation times.

1.4 My Failed First Attempts to Recreate Alexander’s Results
Computers and their programs relish dwelling on ﬂaws in your thinking—Alexander was not exempt. By engaging in hermeneutics and software archeology, I was able to uncover / discover the trajectory of his thinking as he encountered failures and setbacks with his computer programs. My attempted replication also failed, and that led me to try to unearth the ﬁve diﬀerent programs he wrote, understand them, and ﬁgure out how one led to the next. They are not described in published papers, only in

1947 – DU’s Champion Buggy, the “Flying Pork Barrel”, won a Reroll following a protested Finals (from the 1948 Thistle). 1947 Photos. Here are some photos from 1947. Some of the buggies are unidentified, so if you can ID those, let us know and we’ll update the captions.
Tau Delta Phi Tries To Make Its Debut; PhiKap Struggles. Tau Delta Phi put together a buggy with a bubbled canopy for its first try on the course. Unfortunately, they broke their rear wheel axle (presumably during practice) and were unable to compete on Raceday. On another note, PhiKap lent their buggy to the PhiKap chapter of Pitt for Pitt’s buggy race. Unfortunately, the buggy didn’t have a very good year, as it lost the Pitt race and didn’t qualify for Finals at CMU. Beta Defeats PiKA in
out how many pedestrians they had hit”). The impact was severe enough that KapSig’s buggy was dented, and the time it lost from the impact made it impossible for them to catch up. PiKA eventually passed DTD in the freeroll and went on to win by 30 yards, but by then it didn’t matter. The judges decided to DQ PiKA for interference. The brothers of PiKA didn’t take it lightly though; they immediately lodged a protest against the judge’s decision.
23. Question-answering computers, 2011 Searching the Web for information is rarely as simple as asking a question in plain English. So-called “question-answering” machines moved from laboratories to TV screens when an IBM computer called “Watson” defeated two human champions on the game show “Jeopardy!” At the heart of Watson was computer architecture developed by CMU’s Eric Nyberg and his students.
11. Computer chess, 1990 Could a computer play chess at the level of the world’s best players? For many years, it was considered the “holy grail” of artificial intelligence. Hitech, developed by CMU researcher Hans Berliner (CS’74), was the first computer to achieve grandmaster status. CMU alumni played key roles in developing “Deep Blue,” the IBM machine that beat human chess champion Garry Kasparov in 1997.
Turing Awards and a Nobel Prize In 1975, Simon and Newell were awarded the A.M. Turing Award for their work in artificial intelligence. (As of 2014, 12 CMU alumni or faculty have been awarded Turings, sometimes considered the Nobel Prize of computing.) Three years later, Simon received the Nobel Prize in Economics for his work on decision-making theory. As the 1970s progressed, Newell became interested in human-computer interaction, and began a long relationship with Xerox’s Palo Alto Research
