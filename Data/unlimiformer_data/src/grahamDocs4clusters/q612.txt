Question: If you wanted to take Arts & Community Development in Fall 2023, what were the course numbers of the courses offered?

Context: computer science in the public school system. It also promotes the implementation of computer science in the classroom, for which it develops curricular courses from the ﬁrst year of primary education to the fourth year of secondary education, which are available as a public good for the entire school system, articulating an ecosystem to train and accompany teachers and develop a network of leading schools in the teaching of computer science, which by July 2022 there were more than 80 schools
3 (Xiong We take the ANCE initialized from T5Base et al., 2021; Ge et al., 2023) and Contriever4 (Izac- ard et al., 2021)’s hyperparameters in the augmentation-adapted training. Specifically, we fix batch size as 8, learning rate as 5e-6, and epochs as 6 for ANCE while taking batch size as 8, learning rate as 1e-5, and epochs as 3 for Contriever. We choose their best checkpoints based on the perfor- mance of the development set. The information about our source tasks and target tasks are listed

Once again, 14 organizations (all 12 fraternities, Dorm Council and Citcom Clan) entered the race, and Prelims were run in 5 heats. The first 4 Heats had 3 buggies each, while the 5th Heat had only 2. Record-Breaking Year. There was little, if any, doubt that a course record would be broken this year. And in fact, each of DTD, PiKA, and KapSig,

Racers then traveled toward Margaret Morrison Carnegie Hall, went up Tech Street, down through Schenley Park and then turned back to campus.
