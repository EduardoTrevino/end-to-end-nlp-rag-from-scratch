Question: In fall 2023, When does unit 02601 take place on Fridays?

Context: Eq. (2) encapsulates the recurrence relation of the S4 models (Gu et al., 2022; Gupta et al., 2022), S5 model (Smith et al., 2023), and Linear Recurrent Unit (Orvieto et al., 2023). For example, A is in the family of HiPPO matrix (Gu et al., 2023) in S4 or a complex diagonal matrix in Linear Recurrent Unit. We show in Proposition 1 that such input- independent A matrix cannot represent subtraction.

Proposition 1. An input-independent LRNN is in- consistent in representing subtraction.
next. This departs from other current models that attempt, for example, to ground N400

ERP effects directly

from single-unit responses, with no causal-explanatory

mechanism

linking

them (Samimizad et al., 2022), or models

that relate

47

neurotransmitter profiles to the N400, without a mechanistic bridge tying together

these scales of analysis (Hagoort, 2013).

1946 saw the return of Buggy, though not all of the Fraternities were back yet. It also saw a rain delay and a very controversial result.
Buggy is Back! The War is over, and Spring Carnival is back with Buggy! The first year back was a short one though, as Spring Carnival was only a 2-day event, kicking off with Buggy at 4:30pm on Friday. The field was small (only 9 teams), as not all of the fraternities on campus had reactivated following the War. Buggy secrecy came back as well, as the April 30, 1946 Tartan reported that DU was building their new buggy off-campus, and were so secretive about it that not even their brothers had
