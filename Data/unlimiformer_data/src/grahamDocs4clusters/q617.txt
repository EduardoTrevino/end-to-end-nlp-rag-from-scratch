Question: What is the name of the proposed method that extends WavLM's joint prediction and denoising to 40k hours of data across 136 languages?

Context: In our experiments, we use a pre-trained WavLM model1 [17] to extract hidden embeddings. It was trained pri- marily on learning the masked language models by predicting the pseudo-labels while performing speech denoising simul- taneously. It achieved the best results on many downstream tasks in the SUPERB [20]. Note that the WavLM large model used comprises 24 hidden layers. The last Transformer-Encoder layer from the model is chosen to extract hidden embeddings because it has been reported
This work proposes DPHuBERT, a task-agnostic compres- sion method based on joint distillation and structured pruning. DPHuBERT outperforms previous distillation methods in most tasks of SUPERB. Comprehensive analyses are presented to in- vestigate its performance with less training data or at various sparsity ratios. In addition to HuBERT Base, our method can be directly applied to other speech SSL models such as WavLM and HuBERT Large while still being efficient and effective. In the future,
In Table. 5, we present the performance on LibriSpeech 960 hours data with speed perturbation. As baselines, we listed the conventional FBank-based ASR system and the WavLM-Large

After an hour-long argument with the judges (and presumably the Sweepstakes committee), the decision to DQ PiKA was upheld and DTD was awarded the victory. Final Time. The Tartan reported that DTD’s winning time was 3:49, but our database has the time as 2:49. 3:49 would be significantly slower than any other race on this course, but I also think it’s possible. Bleak skies threatened the race (meaning it may have been bad weather), the best Prelim time was 3:24.5, and DTD was the 2nd buggy to
Tartan, Heat 1 saw a very tight race between KapSig, DTD, and PiKA, with KapSig winning in 3:24.5, DTD finishing in 3:25.1, and PiKA finishing in 3:26.3. Those were the top 3 times and they advanced to the finals. Prelim Heat 2 paired Beta, SAE, and DU, and SAE won the heat by default, as Beta was DQ’d for a pushbar violation and DU was DQ’d for a Hill 4-5 transition violation (the Tartan reports that they “shoved the buggy into the last zone instead of pushing it”). Prelims Heat 3 was a battle
cross the finish line in the Finals. So is it possible that DTD rolled 35 seconds faster during the Finals? Sure. But I think I buy that they were 25 seconds slower a little more. 1947 Raceday: Prelims on Friday, May 2 at 1:00pm; Finals on Saturday, May 3 at 2:30pm
