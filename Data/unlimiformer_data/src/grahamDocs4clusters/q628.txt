Question: What version of ChatGPT is used to extract facts in the FacTool paper?

Context: Math Problems The fact-checking capability of FACTOOL on math problems is determined by the LLM’s capability to generate accurate Python snip- pets that verify the correctness of given extracted mathematical calculations. Both FACTOOL pow- ered by GPT-4 and FACTOOL powered by Chat- GPT excel in this regard. For example, both FAC- TOOL powered by GPT-4 and FACTOOL pow- ered by ChatGPT correctly identify 23 × 4319216 doesn’t equal to 99305768. Detailed examples can be found in Fig. 13 of Appendix
With the above challenges in mind, in this paper, we propose FACTOOL, a task and do- main agnostic framework for detecting factual errors of texts generated by large language models (e.g., ChatGPT). Experiments on four different tasks (knowledge-based QA, code generation, mathematical reasoning, and sci- entific literature review) show the efficacy of the proposed method. We release the code of FACTOOL associated with ChatGPT plu- gin interface at https://github.com/ GAIR-NLP/factool.

and the organizations snuck out at midnight to get some practice on the course. Avoiding Controversies. After the controversy of 1947 (which, sadly and as noted above, we don’t have details of), Sweepstakes decided to tighten up the rules to avoid any confusion for Raceday. Of course, we don’t have the rules that were tightened either. We’ll keep digging, and if we find it out, we’ll update this post. On the plus side, 1948 didn’t appear to have any controversies. Prelim Results. Raceday itself
Sweepstakes Slang

Buggy: Vehicle being raced and also a nickname for the competition.

Chute: A section of the freeroll portion of the buggy course (near the southwestern end of Frew Street at its intersection with Schenley Drive) where buggies make the sharp righthand turn from Schenley Drive onto Frew Street.

Chute Flagger: Team member who provides a signal for buggy drivers to know when to start the right-hand turn from Schenley Drive onto Frew Street.
We don’t have many details of the race itself, but DTD took the win, just barely edging out KapSig, who was less than 1 second behind. DTD’s goggled driver was Dick Stanley, and the Hill 5 pusher working very hard was Barry Rowles. As a consolation prize, KapSig’s streamlined aluminum buggy (which looks just like a slightly larger version of today’s designs, with an extra wheel) took home the Design Comp trophy.
