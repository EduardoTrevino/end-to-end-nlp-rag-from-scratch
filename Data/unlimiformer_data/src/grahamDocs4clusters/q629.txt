Question: Where is FACTORCL published?

Context: Paper title: 'Factorized Contrastive Learning: Going Beyond Multi-view Redundancy' Published year: 2023 Publication venue or conference: arXiv.org Authors: Louis-Philippe Morency, P. Liang, Martin Q. Ma, R. Salakhutdinov, James Y. Zou, Zihao Deng Summary: FactorCL is a new multimodal representation learning method to go beyond multi-view redundancy and captures both shared and unique information and achieves state-of-the-art results on six benchmarks.
FACTORCL on a suite of synthetic datasets and large-scale real-world multimodal benchmarks involving images and figurative language [87], prediction of human sentiment [90], emotions [92], humor [27], and sarcasm [12], as well as patient disease and mortality prediction from health indicators and sensor readings [37], achieving new state-of-the-art performance on six datasets. Overall, we summarize our key technical contributions here:
contained in modality-unique regions: information that is only present in one modality but still relevant to the task. How can we learn self-supervised multimodal representations to capture both shared and unique information relevant to down- stream tasks? This paper proposes FACTORCL, a new multimodal representation learning method to go beyond multi-view redundancy. FACTORCL is built from three new contributions: (1) factorizing task-relevant information into shared and unique

seen it yet! And On New Roads! This is the first record we have of the roads being paved! 2 weeks before Raceday, the City of Pittsburgh re-paved the Buggy course, allowing the buggies to race on fresh roadways. Pittsburgh Police were also out in full force on Raceday to assist with course control…Though as you’ll see, this was probably only during the Prelims. New Rules in Place. The April 9, 1946 Tartan printed the 12 rules for Buggy, our first look at the rules in several years. A lot of the
