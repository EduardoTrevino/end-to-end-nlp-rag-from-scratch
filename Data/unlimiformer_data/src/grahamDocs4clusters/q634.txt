Question: What is StarCoderBase trained on?

Context: ﬁltering ablations. One of our main ﬁndings was that ﬁltering for Github stars consistently decreased performance across all benchmarks and programming languages. Using the ﬁndings of these abla- tion studies, we trained a ﬁnal 1.1B model—dubbed SantaCoder—for 236B tokens and showed it is able to outperform previous multi-lingual code models (InCoder-6.7B and CodeGen-Multi-2.7B) on both left-to-right generation and inﬁlling tasks. We anticipate that larger architectures and more training data
Findings We ﬁnd all BigCode Santa variants with 1.1B parameters to outperform the 6.7B In- Coder model (Fried et al., 2022), which we attribute to differences in the training datasets. Among BigCode models, variants trained on more Python perform better: The stars variant with 32% of Python in its training corpus outperforms the tokenizer fertility variant with only 28.5% of Python (see proportions in Table 3). The bfloat16 is the same as the no-ﬁm variant, except for the lat- ter being trained
We investigate the impact of 4 preprocessing methods on the training data: ﬁltering ﬁles from repositories with 5+ GitHub stars, ﬁltering ﬁles with a high comments-to-code ratio, more aggressive ﬁltering of near-duplicates, and ﬁltering ﬁles with a low character-to-token ratio. We observe modest impact of the new ﬁlters except for the stars ﬁlter, which deterio- rates performance on text2code benchmarks signiﬁcantly. This is an interesting result given that previous work has explicitly ﬁltered

First Non-Greek Orgs. 14 Organizations were entered for Raceday in 1948. They included all 12 fraternities (ATO, Beta, Beta Sigma Rho, DTD, DU, KapSig, PhiKap, PiKA, SAE, SigNu, Tau Delta Phi, and Theta Xi), the Men’s Dorms, and Citcom Clan (the commuters – “Citcom” is short for “CIT Commuter”). Although the Men’s Dorms were permitted to enter as far back as 1928, this is the first year that we have evidence that any organization other than a Greek actually did so. Training started in April,
Fairings have been a key feature for the Fringe team in recent years, which is celebrating its 50th anniversary of Buggy.

"We have a reputation of being the quietest on the course," said Diya Nuxoll, who wrapped up her bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering in December and is working on an advanced studies master's degree in design and manufacturing. Nuxoll leads the Fringe team as one of two head mechanics.
Tishya Girdhar, a junior in neuroscience, is social chair for Fringe. She came to CMU wanting to drive, but first she had to get over being claustrophobic. She started as a mechanic and got behind the wheel for last year's Sweepstakes.

"Our team's philosophy is to teach everyone how to do everything," Girdhar said. "But I came to CMU wanting to drive. I wanted to drive so badly."
21. RNA sequencing via videogames, 2010 Thanks to crowdsourcing, science isn’t just for scientists any more. People without formal training in molecular biology are producing new insights into genetic encoding through a videogame called EteRNA, developed by researchers at CMU and Stanford, that allows players to fold and shift RNA molecules to solve on-screen puzzles.
