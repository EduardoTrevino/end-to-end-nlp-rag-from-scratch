Question: How many credits is Human Language for AI worth?

Context: The problem of aligning large language models (LLMs) to human values and intentions in terms of being comprehensive, respectful, and compliant1 [10, 32, 30, 4, 5, 27] has gained significant attention in research as recent AI systems (like ChatGPT or GPT-4) have rapidly advanced in their capabilities [12, 33, 7, 9]. Presently, state-of-the-art AI systems predominantly depend on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with human instructions and annotations, as well as reinforcement learning from human
the prefer- ences with the reward model, subsequently influencing the behavior of the RL- trained policies, and eliminating the reliance on the collection of online human preferences. Applying our method to the LLaMA-2-70b base language model, we developed an AI assistant named Dromedary-2. With only 6 exemplars for in-context learning and 31 human-defined principles, Dromedary-2 signifi- cantly surpasses the performance of several state-of-the-art AI systems, including LLaMA-2-Chat-70b, on
diversity, self-consistency, and undesirable biases. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach called SELF-ALIGN, which combines principle-driven reasoning and the generative power of LLMs for the self-alignment of the AI agents with minimal human supervision. Applying SELF-ALIGN to the LLaMA-65b base language model, we develop an AI assistant named Dromedary . With fewer than 300 lines of human anno- tations (including < 200 seed prompts, 16 generic principles, and 5 exemplars

But a few of the specific rules changed slightly, or are worth noting again: All drivers, pushers, designers and builders were required to members of the organization they’re competing for All team members (including designers and builders) must be “eligible” under the Executive Board’s requirements, which include a minimum of 36 units and being in good academic standing (with a minimum GPA requirement). The buggy/driver combo must weigh a minimum of 180 pounds (up from the previous 160 lbs)
First Non-Greek Orgs. 14 Organizations were entered for Raceday in 1948. They included all 12 fraternities (ATO, Beta, Beta Sigma Rho, DTD, DU, KapSig, PhiKap, PiKA, SAE, SigNu, Tau Delta Phi, and Theta Xi), the Men’s Dorms, and Citcom Clan (the commuters – “Citcom” is short for “CIT Commuter”). Although the Men’s Dorms were permitted to enter as far back as 1928, this is the first year that we have evidence that any organization other than a Greek actually did so. Training started in April,
Safety is a top priority for teams. All drivers are required to have five pieces of safety gear: mouth guard, goggles, a harness that includes three points of contact to the body of the buggy, gloves and a helmet. And during practice runs and races, flaggers man the course to let drivers know if it's safe to proceed.
10-605, Machine Learning with Large Data sets (12 units). First spring semester.

11-611, Natural Language Processing (12 units). Second fall semester.

11-785, Deep Learning (12 unit s). Second spring semester.

One more 12-unit AI, ML or NLP course of the student’s choice (with approval of the

Program Director)

In the event that a course is not available, a course covering equivalent material with a
Core Course: - Human Language for Artificial Intelligence (11-411)
course. No undergraduat e courses count toward the 195-unit requirement.

All Core courses are organized in sequence, and must be taken in the following order:

Artificial Intelligence and Future Markets (11-651) – No prerequisite.

AI Engineering (11-695) – Prerequisite is the co mpletion of 11-651 with a grade of “B” or

better.

LTI Practicum (11-935) – Three credit units for completing the required Internship.
