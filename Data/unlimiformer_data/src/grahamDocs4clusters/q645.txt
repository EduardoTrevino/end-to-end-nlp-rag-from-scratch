Question: What is the name of the initiative introduced to track and incentivize the global development of equitable language technology?

Context: This work was initiated at and benefited substan- tially from the Dagstuhl Seminar 22232: Efficient and Equitable Natural Language Processing in the Age of Deep Learning. We further thank Niran- jan Balasubramanian, Jonathan Frankle, Michael Hassid, Kenneth Heafield, Sara Hooker, Alexan- der Koller, Alexandra Sasha Luccioni, Alexander Löser, André F. T. Martins, Colin Raffel, Nils Reimers, Leonardo Riberio, Anna Rogers, Ed- win Simpson, Noam Slonim, Noah A. Smith, and Thomas Wolf for a fruitful
strategic initiative of digital and AI transformation to usher in an open, more linguistically-inclusive, and culturally-aware era.
Large Language Models (LLMs) The field of natural language processing has witnessed remark- able advancements with the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), which have significantly improved various NLP tasks. The introduction of the Transformer architecture [46] laid the ground- work for the development of these powerful language models (Devlin et al. 12, Radford et al. 33, Lewis et al. 21, Raffel et al. 34, Brown et al. 7, Chowdhery et al. 9, Zhang et al. 52, Scao et al. 36, Touvron et al.
