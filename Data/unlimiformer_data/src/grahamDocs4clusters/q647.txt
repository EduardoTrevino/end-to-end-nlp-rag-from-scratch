1024 hidden states, 16 attention heads, 1024 word vector size, 4,096 hidden units, 0.2 la- bel smoothing, 0.0002 training learning rate and ﬁnetuning 0.00005 learning rate, 0.1 dropout and attention dropout, “adam” optimizer and “noam” decay method (Fan et al., 2021; Schwenk et al., 2021; El-Kishky et al., 2020).
With this tokenizer we train a Masked Language Model following Yu et al. (2023a), using the token factorization described in Section 3.2. We train for 1080 epochs in accordance with the prior best model MDT (Gao et al., 2023), with batch size 1024 for better efficiency. For preprocessing and data augmentation, we randomly crop 80-100% of an image while keeping the aspect ratio, followed by random horizontal flipping. The class label is dropped for 10% of the training batches to enable

But a few of the specific rules changed slightly, or are worth noting again: All drivers, pushers, designers and builders were required to members of the organization they’re competing for All team members (including designers and builders) must be “eligible” under the Executive Board’s requirements, which include a minimum of 36 units and being in good academic standing (with a minimum GPA requirement). The buggy/driver combo must weigh a minimum of 180 pounds (up from the previous 160 lbs)
Today, it takes six people to maneuver the .84 -mile course around Schenley Park's Flagstaff Hill.

But while five pushers and a driver navigate the course's hills, dozens of people are needed to make a successful race happen. A year of planning goes into just over two minutes of racing.
Delta Upsilon entered a three-wheeled buggy in 1940.

It’s quirky, it’s different, and it’s so Carnegie Mellon University, where the college experience is a little buggy.
