Question: What tasks does ESPnet-ST-v2 support?

Context: We presented ESPnet-ST-v2 which now supports offline speech translation, simultaneous speech translation, and offline speech-to-speech transla- tion. ESPnet-ST-v2 will continue to grow to sup- port the community’s interests. Future updates may include more new tasks, such as simultane- ous speech-to-speech translation, and cross-toolkit integrations via TorchAudio.

Limitations
ESPnet-ST-v2 is a revamp of the open-source ESPnet-ST toolkit necessitated by the broad- ening interests of the spoken language trans- lation community. ESPnet-ST-v2 supports 1) offline speech-to-text translation (ST), 2) simul- taneous speech-to-text translation (SST), and 3) offline speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) – each task is supported with a wide variety of approaches, differentiating ESPnet-ST-v2 from other open source spoken language trans- lation toolkits. This toolkit offers
Figure 1 illustrates the software architecture of ESPnet-ST-v2. This modular design is an improve- ment over the ESPnet-ST-v1 where monolithic model and task definitions made it more difficult to extend and modify the toolkit. We also designed ESPnet-ST-v2 such that modules developed for ad- jacent tasks (e.g. ASR, TTS, MT) can also be readily used for spoken language translation.
