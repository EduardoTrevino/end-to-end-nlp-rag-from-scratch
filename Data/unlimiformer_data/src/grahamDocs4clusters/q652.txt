Question: When did Kappa Kappa Gamma enter the first all-women’s team in buggy history?

Context: feedback on model-generated outputs, and has led to the emergence of the first widely-used general- purpose language assistants (OpenAI, 2023a). Hu- man feedback not only enhances system perfor- mance, but also serves as a mechanism to steer the system in alignment with desired outcomes or goals (Rosenblueth et al., 1943; Wiener, 1948).

participants recalled the rise of bench- marks in the late 1990s and early 2000s, coinciding with a major expansion in the NLP community in the wake of the “statistical revolution,” where participants described statistical models displacing more traditional rules-based work (see Figure 2). In the words of one participant, the field became of “such a big snowballing size that nobody owned the first evers anymore.” (26). Instead, after the release of the Penn Treebank in 1993 and the reporting of

The starting line from the inaugural race in June 1920 was outside what is now known as the College of Fine Arts building. Racers then traveled toward Margaret Morrison Carnegie Hall, went up Tech Street, down through Schenley Park and then turned back to campus. Buggies would then take pit stops and have their rear wheels swapped before heading back toward the starting line.

Alpha Kappa Psi, the first sorority to enter a Buggy on race day, in 1922.
“Buggy doesn’t exist anywhere else. It’s a 100-year love of creation and collaboration,” said Olivia Keller at dawn on the inaugural morning practice — called first rolls — in late September. “That the alumni network can be so involved, that they continue to be passionate about buggy long after they’ve gone is very telling of how amazing and special buggy is. It’s part of the CMU experience,” said the senior chemical engineering major, pusher and chair of this year’s Kappa Kappa Gamma and Kappa
First Non-Greek Orgs. 14 Organizations were entered for Raceday in 1948. They included all 12 fraternities (ATO, Beta, Beta Sigma Rho, DTD, DU, KapSig, PhiKap, PiKA, SAE, SigNu, Tau Delta Phi, and Theta Xi), the Men’s Dorms, and Citcom Clan (the commuters – “Citcom” is short for “CIT Commuter”). Although the Men’s Dorms were permitted to enter as far back as 1928, this is the first year that we have evidence that any organization other than a Greek actually did so. Training started in April,
With the end of World War II, the latter half of the 20th century brought unprecedented growth to Carnegie Tech. In 1956, the arrival of the first IBM computer to campus was revolutionary, initiating a university culture where information technology pervaded virtually all areas of study. University culture also changed in 1973 when Margaret Morrison closed and women joined their male peers in classrooms and dorms. The times were changing, and Tech positioned itself at the forefront, opening
Launching a Robotics Institute In 1979, an executive at Pittsburgh’s Westinghouse Electric Corp., Tom Murrin, collaborated with Jordan and Reddy to create the Robotics Institute, with Reddy as its first director. By 1982, the Computer Science Department included more than 30 faculty members and 100 graduate students.
