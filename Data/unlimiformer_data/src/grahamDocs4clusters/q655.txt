Question: Which languages are included in the dataset released by "Multi-lingual and Multi-cultural Figurative Language Understanding"?

Context: dataset, MABL, for seven diverse languages associated with a variety of cultures: Hindi, Indonesian, Javanese, Kannada, Sundanese, Swahili and Yoruba. Our dataset reveals that each language relies on cultural and regional concepts for fig- urative expressions, with the highest overlap between languages originating from the same region. We assess multilingual LMs’ abili- ties to interpret figurative language in zero- shot and few-shot settings. All languages ex- hibit a significant deficiency

6. IRFL [87] is a dataset for understanding multimodal figurative languages. It contains 6, 697 matching images and figurative captions (rather than literal captions) of three types of figurative languages: idiom, simile, and metaphor. The original data for the matching task is provided in the form of 1 caption, 3 distractor images, and 1 matching image. We convert it into a fusion task by only collecting the matching image and text pairs and assigning labels using the type of figurative

First Non-Greek Orgs. 14 Organizations were entered for Raceday in 1948. They included all 12 fraternities (ATO, Beta, Beta Sigma Rho, DTD, DU, KapSig, PhiKap, PiKA, SAE, SigNu, Tau Delta Phi, and Theta Xi), the Men’s Dorms, and Citcom Clan (the commuters – “Citcom” is short for “CIT Commuter”). Although the Men’s Dorms were permitted to enter as far back as 1928, this is the first year that we have evidence that any organization other than a Greek actually did so. Training started in April,
Carnegie Mellon's official mascot debuted at the Nov. 10, 2007 home football game. The graphic features a profile of a distinguished, bold Scottish terrier sporting a plaid scarf around his neck. The dog is contained in a shield, representing Carnegie Mellon's Scottish heritage.

The Task Force then partnered with a mascot costume company to design our Scottish terrier in the winter of 2007. The official Scotty costume was unveiled at the 2008 Spring Carnival.
