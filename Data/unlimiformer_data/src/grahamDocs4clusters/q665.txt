offered by the Language Technologies Institute (LTI), a graduate department in the School of

Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University. The MIIS degree provides advanced study

and practical experience in areas of Computer Science focused on the processing and analysis

of unstructured and semi -structured information, for example, text, image, video, speech, and

audio information. It is a practice -oriented professional degree designed for students who
Information retrieval, machine translation and speech technology are used daily by the general public, while text mining, natural language processing and language-based tutoring are common within more specialized professional or educational environments. The LTI prepares students for this world by offering a minor that gives you the opportunity to not only learn about language technologies, but to also apply that knowledge through a directed project.
Any two graduate courses (600 -level or higher) offered by departments within the SCS

relevant to the MIIS degree other than LTI (Machine Learning or Computer Science departments, etc.) may be counted as approved qualifying courses . MIIS Graduate Student Handbook  Page 15

Any course from the following list is an approved qualifying course.

02-712, Computational Methods for Biological Modeling and Simulation

05-631, Software Structures for User interfaces

05-813, Human Factors
