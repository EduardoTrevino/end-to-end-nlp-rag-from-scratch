The joint-feedback modeling with feedback models was explored by Korbak et al. (2023), who study pre-training an LLMs with a loss similar to Equation 6, based on feedback from a preference model trained on ranking-based feedback for tox- icity. They showed that this leads to models pro- ducing less toxic generations, when compared to pretraining a model with vanilla MLE.

Déjà vu. Much like the prior years, the Tartan didn’t seem too interested with Buggy in 1949. So what we know is that 1949 seems very similar to 1948. Once again, 14 organizations (all 12 fraternities, Dorm Council and Citcom Clan) entered the race, and Prelims were run in 5 heats. The first 4 Heats had 3 buggies each, while the 5th Heat had only 2. Record-Breaking Year. There was little, if any, doubt that a course record would be broken this year. And in fact, each of DTD, PiKA, and KapSig,
1947 – Starting Line of a Prelims Heat (from the 1948 Thistle). Unknown buggy in Lane 1, Theta Xi in Lane 2, and an unknown (barely visible) buggy in Lane 3.

1947 – Prelim (Unknown Heat) Back Hills (from the 1948 Thistle). Beta’s snow plow buggy (with dragon) leading (far left), KapSig 2nd (far right), SigNu trailing (middle)

Who wore it best? 1947 – DU and DTD on Hill 1 during what we now believe might be the Finals (from the 1948 Thistle).
Tartan, Heat 1 saw a very tight race between KapSig, DTD, and PiKA, with KapSig winning in 3:24.5, DTD finishing in 3:25.1, and PiKA finishing in 3:26.3. Those were the top 3 times and they advanced to the finals. Prelim Heat 2 paired Beta, SAE, and DU, and SAE won the heat by default, as Beta was DQ’d for a pushbar violation and DU was DQ’d for a Hill 4-5 transition violation (the Tartan reports that they “shoved the buggy into the last zone instead of pushing it”). Prelims Heat 3 was a battle
16. CAPTCHAs, 2000 “Spam” and malicious attacks were a growing problem on the Internet when hackers developed automated “bots” that could sign up for email and other Web services without human intervention. Luis von Ahn (CS’03,’05), Nick Hopper (CS’04), John Langford (CS’02) and CMU professor Manuel Blum invented a “Completely Automated Public Turing Test to tell Computers and Humans Apart,” or CAPTCHA, to help foil the bots. A later variation, reCAPTCHA, is helping digitize old books and
thesis defense. The pre sentation must communicate the research work done, similar to

a conference paper presentation. The committee will observe the presentation, and then decide whether the thesis and presentation were acceptable, or whether further

work is required. Unlike a P hD defense, only a simple majority vote of the committee is

required for approval.
13.7 Academic Calendar

The official academic calendar is published by Enro llment Services. It is not uncommon for

departments and colleges to have academic requir ements that differ from or are in addition to

those presented in the academic calendar provided to the campus community by Enrollment Services. See https://www.cmu.edu/hub/calendar/ docs/2223-academic-calendar.pdf ..
