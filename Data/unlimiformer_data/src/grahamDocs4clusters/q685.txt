Question: According to ChatGPT MT, what is the most important feature in determining ChatGPT's relative ability to translate a language?

Context: first exper- imental evidence for an expansive set of 204 languages, along with MT cost analysis, using the FLORES-200 benchmark. Trends reveal that GPT models approach or exceed traditional MT model performance for some high-resource languages (HRLs) but consistently lag for low- resource languages (LRLs), under-performing traditional MT for 84.1% of languages we cov- ered. Our analysis reveals that a language’s resource level is the most important feature in determining ChatGPT’s relative
Prior research suggests that ChatGPT output qual- ity is sensitive to language script (Bang et al., 2023). Our own analysis in §3.4 actually suggests that script is the least important language feature in pre- dicting ChatGPT’s MT effectiveness. However, dif- ferences in performance are clear when comparing scripts used for the same language. Table 8 shows one script typically outperforming the other, by an average of 14.3 chrF points for zero-shot. Five- shot contexts narrowed the gap slightly

In recent years, generative LLMs have shown increasingly impressive translation abilities (Rad- ford et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020). Even more recently, LLM tools like ChatGPT have become popular and accessible to end users. This marks an important shift, since a majority of LLM users are now consumers rather than researchers. The

Fairings have been a key feature for the Fringe team in recent years, which is celebrating its 50th anniversary of Buggy.

"We have a reputation of being the quietest on the course," said Diya Nuxoll, who wrapped up her bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering in December and is working on an advanced studies master's degree in design and manufacturing. Nuxoll leads the Fringe team as one of two head mechanics.
Fun Fact about Scottish terrier

The Scottish terrier breed is known for its keen, alert and intelligent expression. Its temperament is described as determined and thoughtful while its physical aspects exemplify strength, power and agility in a small package. Many of these traits are also apparent throughout the university, making the Scottish terrier a natural choice for Carnegie Mellon's mascot.
According to the CIT Alumnus from May, the finals were “undecided”, and per the 1948 Thistle, the race ended in protest. But whatever happened seemed to be between PiKA and DU, because the two of them were granted a reroll to determine the winner. And in that reroll, DU’s “Flying Pork Barrel” buggy, with cowboy hat-wearing driver, crossed the finish line first, earning the victory. DTD apparently came in 3rd, finishing in a time of 3:00. If you know anything about this protest (or anything else
Information retrieval, machine translation and speech technology are used daily by the general public, while text mining, natural language processing and language-based tutoring are common within more specialized professional or educational environments. The LTI prepares students for this world by offering a minor that gives you the opportunity to not only learn about language technologies, but to also apply that knowledge through a directed project.
9. Machine translation, 1984 Every “Star Trek” fan knows about the universal translator. Scientists in the Language Technologies Institute are moving those gadgets from science fiction to real life. Their pioneering systems include handheld, portable speech-to-speech translators, just like those depicted on the USS Enterprise.
