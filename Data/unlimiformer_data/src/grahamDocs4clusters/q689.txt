Question: In spring 2024, When do Mini-4 classes begin?

Context: Mini GPT-4 [Zhu et al., 2023] uses a pretrained Q-Former module from [Li et al., 2023] to project images encoded by EVA CLIP ViT-G/14 [Fang et al., 2022] to Vicuna’s [Chiang et al., 2023] text embedding space. Both CLIP and Vicuna are frozen, while a section of the Q-former is finetuned on a subset of LAION [Schuhmann et al., 2021], Conceptual Captions [Sharma et al., 2018], SBU [Ordonez et al., 2011], and multimodal instruction-following data generated by the authors.
(Dai et al., 2023). Otter (Li et al., 2023b;a) focuses on enhancing OpenFlamingo’s instruction-following capability. MiniGPT-4 (Zhu et al., 2023) suggests GPT4’s prowess is due to sophisticated LLMs and recommends using a sin- gle project layer to align visual and linguistic models. It showcases abilities akin to GPT4 but is computationally efficient. mPLUG-Owl (Ye et al., 2023) offers a new approach: initially aligning

Delta Upsilon entered a three-wheeled buggy in 1940.

It’s quirky, it’s different, and it’s so Carnegie Mellon University, where the college experience is a little buggy.

Sweepstakes, better known as the Spring Carnival Buggy Races, will celebrate its 100th anniversary April 17-18, 2020. The CMU tradition is unlike any other.

Buggy Races Keep Rolling at Carnegie Mellon

In its 99th year, the tradition is a Spring Carnival treat

By Heidi Opdyke

Sweepstakes, also known as the Buggy Races, has come a long way at Carnegie Mellon University. The slick, torpedo-like vessels carrying drivers with nerves of steel are a far cry from the two-man teams that once changed places halfway through a race and rode in everything from rain barrels with bicycle wheels to three-wheeled ash cans 99 years ago.
1948 saw the first independent orgs and the start of DTD’s run of greatness, but it wasn’t easy, as they barely held off KapSig for the championship.
