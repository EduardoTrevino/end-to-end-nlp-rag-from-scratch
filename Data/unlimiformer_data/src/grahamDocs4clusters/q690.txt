Question: Has Professor Carolyn Rose worked on Automatic Essay Scoring?

Context: We studied how GEN evolved over time, by batching MONSERRATE corpus and evaluating the performance of the system as new patterns were learned and past ones were weighed. Results with automatic metrics showed that GEN was able to obtain higher overall scores across all metrics, in different parameterizations for the weighing strategies applied, when compared with the two baselines set: original patterns with no learning, and learning new patterns but not scoring them. The success of this
In machine translation, Fernandes et al. (2022) and Freitag et al. (2022a) build upon recent ad- vances in automatic quality estimation and evalu- ation via feedback model training to improve gen- eration. Their framework comprises a candidate generation stage followed by a ranking stage, in which the candidates are scored using quality met- rics trained to regress on human assessments (re- ward models) (Rei et al., 2020a,b) via N -best list reranking or minimum Bayes risk (MBR) decod- ing

Title: Search Engines
Fairings have been a key feature for the Fringe team in recent years, which is celebrating its 50th anniversary of Buggy.

"We have a reputation of being the quietest on the course," said Diya Nuxoll, who wrapped up her bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering in December and is working on an advanced studies master's degree in design and manufacturing. Nuxoll leads the Fringe team as one of two head mechanics.
Tishya Girdhar, a junior in neuroscience, is social chair for Fringe. She came to CMU wanting to drive, but first she had to get over being claustrophobic. She started as a mechanic and got behind the wheel for last year's Sweepstakes.

"Our team's philosophy is to teach everyone how to do everything," Girdhar said. "But I came to CMU wanting to drive. I wanted to drive so badly."
1948 – Barry Rowles (DTD Hill 5) works hard to get DTD (left) across the finish line first, edging out KapSig (right) for the trophy (from the 1949 Thistle). First “Broadcast”. 1948 is the first indication that we have of a “broadcast” on Raceday. According to the May 18, 1948 Tartan, a jeep patrolled the course and carried both the starter and a PA system, allowing the occupants of the vehicle to broadcast the race to the spectators on the course (as long as you were in range to hear the PA
