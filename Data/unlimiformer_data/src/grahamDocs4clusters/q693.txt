Question: In spring 2024, What is the voucher deadline for Mini-3?

Context: Mini GPT-4 [Zhu et al., 2023] uses a pretrained Q-Former module from [Li et al., 2023] to project images encoded by EVA CLIP ViT-G/14 [Fang et al., 2022] to Vicuna’s [Chiang et al., 2023] text embedding space. Both CLIP and Vicuna are frozen, while a section of the Q-former is finetuned on a subset of LAION [Schuhmann et al., 2021], Conceptual Captions [Sharma et al., 2018], SBU [Ordonez et al., 2011], and multimodal instruction-following data generated by the authors.
which are presented in § A.3 Table 5. For MiniLM-L6-30M, the all-domain pre-training improves the best-seed accuracy in all cases. For DeBERTA-v3-435M, there is either a substantial degradation or a small decrease/increase that is not statistically significant (denoted by super-script label “c”). Thus, our biggest model—unlike a 15x smaller MiniLM-L6-30M—does not benefit from all-domain pretraining. However, there is no substantial degradation either.
Not only were we able to reproduce key findings from prior work (Bonifacio et al., 2022), but, combining the original InPars recipe (Bonifacio et al., 2022) with (1) fine-tuning on consistency-checked data (Dai et al., 2022) and (2) all-domain pretraining, we trained an efficient yet small model MiniLM-L6-30M consistently outperforming BM25 in the unsupervised setting. In the same scenario, using a larger DeBERTA-v3-435M model, we largely matched performance of a 7x larger monoT5-3B.

The Finals, initially scheduled for 2pm on Saturday, May 4, were ultimately postponed until Saturday, May 11, due to a downpour that cast a damper on an otherwise exciting Spring Carnival. Controversial Finals. An overcast sky threatened rain on the makeup date as well, though it held off long enough for the race to be run. But some of the spectators may have wished the rain came sooner. Although signs were posted about the makeup date, cars ignored the notices and ended up blocking part of the
Delta Upsilon entered a three-wheeled buggy in 1940.

It’s quirky, it’s different, and it’s so Carnegie Mellon University, where the college experience is a little buggy.

Sweepstakes, better known as the Spring Carnival Buggy Races, will celebrate its 100th anniversary April 17-18, 2020. The CMU tradition is unlike any other.
Fight Over Carnival Schedule. Now that Spring Carnival was back on, the students had to decide how they wanted it – As 2 days in May (losing a day of vacation) or one day in April (not sacrificing any other off days). Buggy was going to happen either way, but ultimately the students voted on a 2 day Carnival, keeping the tradition intact and putting Raceday on the schedule for May 2-3. Time Trials. It looks like this post-war period was when the race changed from a head-to-head to a time trial.
