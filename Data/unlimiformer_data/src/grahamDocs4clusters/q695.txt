The third round of interviews was conducted in July and August 2022, and coincided with the soft launch of the beta version of the toolkit.

et al. (2022), who observed that only monoT5-3B (but not a much smaller monoT5-220M) outperformed BM25 on all collections. Strong performance of MiniLM-L6-30M in our study was due to additional training with consistency-checked data and pre-training on all-domain data (all queries from all collections). To confirm the effectiveness of these procedures, we carried out ablation experiments.

The Tartan reported that DTD’s winning time was 3:49, but our database has the time as 2:49. 3:49 would be significantly slower than any other race on this course, but I also think it’s possible. Bleak skies threatened the race (meaning it may have been bad weather), the best Prelim time was 3:24.5, and DTD was the 2nd buggy to
