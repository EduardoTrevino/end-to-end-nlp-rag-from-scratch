Question: What is the name of the open-scientific collaboration working on the responsible development of Large Language Models for Code?

Context: BigCode2 is an open scientiﬁc collaboration working on the responsible development of large lan- guage models for code, empowering the machine learning and open-source communities through open governance. BigCode was inspired by the BigScience project, an open-scientiﬁc collaboration which culminated in July 2022 with the release of a large multi-lingual language model (Scao et al., 2022). As in BigScience, various BigCode working groups focus on relevant subtopics such as collecting datasets,
The BigCode project is an open-scientiﬁc collaboration working on the responsi- ble development of large language models for code.1 This tech report describes the progress of the collaboration until December 2022, outlining the current state of the Personally Identiﬁable Information (PII) redaction pipeline, the experi- ments conducted to de-risk the model architecture, and the experiments investi- gating better preprocessing methods for the training data. We train 1.1B param- eter models on
RedPajama [7] aims to develop open-source large language models and be- gins by replicating the LLaMA training dataset [36], which boasts over 1.2 tril- lion tokens. This collaborative effort involves entities such as Together, Onto- cord.ai, ETH DS3Lab, Stanford CRFM, Hazy Research, and the MILA Qu´ebec AI Institute. SlimPajama [33] stands as the highly deduplicated, multi-source, open-source dataset tailored for training large language models. This dataset emerged by refining and eliminating

Since the first Campus Week in 1920, when “chariots” were built to race around campus, student groups have been working year-round, using their engineering skills, design expertise and penchant for interdisciplinary collaboration to secretly build, modify and refine the most aerodynamic, torpedo-like vessel they call a “buggy.”
In the spring, the Task Force partnered with SME Branding — a firm with more than 17 years of experience creating mascots for professional sports teams and universities — to develop the graphics for the mascot. During October, students and alumni reviewed potential mascot images in focus groups.
“Buggy doesn’t exist anywhere else. It’s a 100-year love of creation and collaboration,” said Olivia Keller at dawn on the inaugural morning practice — called first rolls — in late September. “That the alumni network can be so involved, that they continue to be passionate about buggy long after they’ve gone is very telling of how amazing and special buggy is. It’s part of the CMU experience,” said the senior chemical engineering major, pusher and chair of this year’s Kappa Kappa Gamma and Kappa
