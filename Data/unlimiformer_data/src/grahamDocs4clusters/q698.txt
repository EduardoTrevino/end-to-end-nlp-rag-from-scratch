Question: Which shared task does "Language-Agnostic Transformers and Assessing ChatGPT-Based Query Rewriting for Multilingual Document-Grounded QA" focus on?

Context: Paper title: 'Language-Agnostic Transformers and Assessing ChatGPT-Based Query Rewriting for Multilingual Document-Grounded QA' Published year: 2023 Publication venue or conference: Workshop on Document-grounded Dialogue and Conversational Question Answering Authors: T. Mitamura, Srijan Bansal, Mitali Potnis, Soham Dinesh Tiwari, Srinivas Gowriraj, Eric Nyberg Summary: This paper assesses the effectiveness of both language-agnostic and language-aware paradigms for multilingual pre-trained
With the above challenges in mind, in this paper, we propose FACTOOL, a task and do- main agnostic framework for detecting factual errors of texts generated by large language models (e.g., ChatGPT). Experiments on four different tasks (knowledge-based QA, code generation, mathematical reasoning, and sci- entific literature review) show the efficacy of the proposed method. We release the code of FACTOOL associated with ChatGPT plu- gin interface at https://github.com/ GAIR-NLP/factool.

Since the first Campus Week in 1920, when “chariots” were built to race around campus, student groups have been working year-round, using their engineering skills, design expertise and penchant for interdisciplinary collaboration to secretly build, modify and refine the most aerodynamic, torpedo-like vessel they call a “buggy.”
In the spring, the Task Force partnered with SME Branding — a firm with more than 17 years of experience creating mascots for professional sports teams and universities — to develop the graphics for the mascot. During October, students and alumni reviewed potential mascot images in focus groups.
Q: Are there auditions? A: No, any member of the campus community with music experience is able to join the Kiltie Band!

Q: Do I have to memorize music? A: No, the music is changed for every show. You should invest in a good and trusty lyre.

Q: When is the first rehearsal? A: On the first day of class (Monday) at 5:30 p.m. in the CUC Studio Theater. If you have questions, please email the Direcator at jolisar@andrew.cmu.edu.
