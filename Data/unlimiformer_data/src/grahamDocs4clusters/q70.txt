Question: To complete the course requirements for the PhD in Language and Information Technologies degree, how many course units of graduate courses does the student have to pass?

Context: Sample: The experiment was carried out with 100 students of the course “Introduction to Programming” in professional technical education, INACAP Ñuñoa branch.

Type of test: multiple-choice test of 45 items with four answer

options (only one correct) (Belmar, 2023).

Estimated completion time: 90 min.

Didactics: Ten principles for teaching programming by Brown

and Wilson.
For its part, UNESCO proposes a master plan for the development of digital skills, in which in one of the sections it highlights some important points in which it points out that the plan should have described aspects on the technological infrastructure in the school, as a necessary prerequisite, teachers trained in the area of digital technologies, and the integration of digital technology within the curriculum, not only in speciﬁc courses but within the goals or objectives (Fau and Moreau,
Submitted in partial fulﬁllment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science.

But a few of the specific rules changed slightly, or are worth noting again: All drivers, pushers, designers and builders were required to members of the organization they’re competing for All team members (including designers and builders) must be “eligible” under the Executive Board’s requirements, which include a minimum of 36 units and being in good academic standing (with a minimum GPA requirement). The buggy/driver combo must weigh a minimum of 180 pounds (up from the previous 160 lbs)
Fairings have been a key feature for the Fringe team in recent years, which is celebrating its 50th anniversary of Buggy.

"We have a reputation of being the quietest on the course," said Diya Nuxoll, who wrapped up her bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering in December and is working on an advanced studies master's degree in design and manufacturing. Nuxoll leads the Fringe team as one of two head mechanics.
