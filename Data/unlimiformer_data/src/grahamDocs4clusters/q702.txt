Question: Where is advanced NLP taught this semester?

Context: Natural language processing (NLP) is in a period of flux. The unprecedented advances of deep neu- ral networks and large language models (LLMs) in NLP coincides with a shift not only in the nature of our research questions and methodology, but also in the size and visibility of our field. Since the mid- 2010s, the number of first-time authors publishing in the ACL Anthology has been increasing expo- nentially (Figure 1). Recent publicity around NLP technology, most notably ChatGPT, has brought

using NLP to advance dogwhistle research. Even though LLMs’ performance is likely due to vast training data, and even then, their outputs require manual verification, our experiments with GPT-3 demonstrate that LLMs have some ability to sur- face dogwhistles and explain their covert meanings. This is particularly valuable as dogwhistles are in- tentionally hidden from out-group members, and out-group researchers may have no other way to access this information. There is thus a unique op-

Fairings have been a key feature for the Fringe team in recent years, which is celebrating its 50th anniversary of Buggy.

"We have a reputation of being the quietest on the course," said Diya Nuxoll, who wrapped up her bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering in December and is working on an advanced studies master's degree in design and manufacturing. Nuxoll leads the Fringe team as one of two head mechanics.
This year Fringe is planning to roll four different vehicles, built and maintained in the Fringe workshop in the basement of the East Campus Garage, known as the "Froom."

"We're used to saying everything with 'fr' in front of it but when we say something in front of other people, it gets them confused," said Fringe head mechanic Dave Singh, who will graduate in May with a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering and biomedical engineering.
1946 was the first clue, since the 3 buggies advancing to the Finals were from the same Prelim Heat. But in 1947, it became more obvious, as there were 4 Prelim Heats but only the 3 teams with the fastest Prelim times advanced to the Finals. Prelims. Sadly, the 1947 Tartan was not very interested in Buggy, so we don’t know much about the race. In fact, all we really know from the Tartan is that PhiKap’s buggy was built by DeBolt, Malenock, Butters, and Gregg, and was driven by Danny Gallo. But
