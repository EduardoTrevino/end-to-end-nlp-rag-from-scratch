Question: What is one limitation of lexical exact-match systems?

Context: We discuss some of the limitations of Advantage-Leftover Lunch RL. First, A-LOL requires that the evaluation metric aligns with the provided rewards. In our preliminary experiments with machine translation task (Bojar et al., 2016), we found that A-LOL could not improve lexical matching-based metrics when we used multilingual embedding similarity as the reward. Furthermore, a single sequence-level reward for each instance will obscure disagreement in how humans would label sequences (i.e.,
CodeBLEU (Ren et al., 2020) attempts to lower the requirement for a lexical exact match, by rely- ing on data-flow and Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) matching as well; nevertheless, valid generations may have different ASTs and data flow from the reference code, which may lead to low CodeBLEU score even when the prediction is correct. Further, partial predictions may be useful for a program-

int i = 0; for (Object elem: this.elements) {
on the lexical exact match of tokens, which does for diversity in implementation, not account variable names, and code conventions. Figure 1 shows an example: given the reference code in Figure 1(a), both BLEU and CrystalBLEU prefer (rank higher) the non-equivalent code in Figure 1(b) over the functionally equivalent code in Figure 1(c).

Depending on Friday and Saturday's conditions, most heats may run just two lanes instead of three. But still, despite some of the challenges, Chen said she wouldn't miss it.

"Being a driver is really fun," Chen said. "I love going fast and going around the course."
and the organizations snuck out at midnight to get some practice on the course. Avoiding Controversies. After the controversy of 1947 (which, sadly and as noted above, we don’t have details of), Sweepstakes decided to tighten up the rules to avoid any confusion for Raceday. Of course, we don’t have the rules that were tightened either. We’ll keep digging, and if we find it out, we’ll update this post. On the plus side, 1948 didn’t appear to have any controversies. Prelim Results. Raceday itself
The streets of the race course haven't changed, but the condition of the course varies due to potholes, which can make or break a fast run. The last course records were set in 2017, but this year potholes are making for some challenging conditions, said Amy Chen, a senior in psychology who has been driving for four years.

With the vehicles just inches from the ground, "even poorly filled potholes makes it dangerous to drive," she added.
20. Kidney donor matching, 2008 Organ transplants save lives every day, but more people could likely be saved if it was easier to match recipients with donors who are unrelated. An algorithm developed by CMU scientists is close to enabling a nationwide network that would match living kidney donors with potential recipients whom they've never met in real life.
potential advisors determine how many new students they can take and  indicate their

preferences. Finally, the entire LTI faculty meets as a " Matching  Committee" to determine the best

set of matches.

Until a student finds a specific advisor, the Progr am Director  of the LTI graduate programs serves

as the advisor.

How to change advisors:  The initial advisor selection should be made carefully. However, it is

Longer -than -standard degree completion may occur due to academic interruptions in making

progress toward the degree as defined by the academic  program, interruptions of full -time

study or progress towards the degree due to  serious, documented medical iss ues, or other
