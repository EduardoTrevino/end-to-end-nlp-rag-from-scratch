Question: In which types of benchmarks has SoftMatch shown substantial improvements?

Context: RLHF improves human alignment benchmarks further. From another angle, even though high- quality instruction data demonstrates large gains in capability assessment, it does not improve much on human-alignment benchmarks including LLaVA-Bench and MMHAL-BENCH, which is also evident in recent LLM studies (Wang et al., 2023). LLaVA-RLHF show a significant improvement in aligning with human values. It attains scores of 2.05 (7b) and 2.53 (13b) on MMHAL-BENCH and improves LLaVA-SFT+ by over 10% on
Experimental results on widely-used IR bench- marks, namely MS MARCO (Nguyen et al., 2016) and TREC DL 2019 (Craswell et al., 2020) & 2020 (Craswell et al., 2021), demonstrate that FiT5 exhibits substantial improvements over traditional retrieve-and-rerank pipelines. Furthermore, FiT5 outperforms systems with more re-ranking stages and/or larger models on the MS MARCO dataset. Further analysis reveals that FiT5 effectively lever- ages ranking features through its global attention architecture,
especially for the chal- lenging benchmark SynLiDAR→ SemanticSTF. The two 2D generalization methods both help SemanticKITTI → SemanticSTF clearly but show very limited improvement over SynLiDAR → SemanticSTF. The proposed PointDR achieves the best generalization consistently across both benchmarks, demonstrating its superior capability to learn perturbation-invariant point cloud representations and ef- fectiveness while handling all-weather 3DSS tasks.

We don’t have many details of the race itself, but DTD took the win, just barely edging out KapSig, who was less than 1 second behind. DTD’s goggled driver was Dick Stanley, and the Hill 5 pusher working very hard was Barry Rowles. As a consolation prize, KapSig’s streamlined aluminum buggy (which looks just like a slightly larger version of today’s designs, with an extra wheel) took home the Design Comp trophy.
and the organizations snuck out at midnight to get some practice on the course. Avoiding Controversies. After the controversy of 1947 (which, sadly and as noted above, we don’t have details of), Sweepstakes decided to tighten up the rules to avoid any confusion for Raceday. Of course, we don’t have the rules that were tightened either. We’ll keep digging, and if we find it out, we’ll update this post. On the plus side, 1948 didn’t appear to have any controversies.

3. Tutoring machines, 1973 Games and drills, such as flash cards, have long been used to help students learn tough subjects. But the cognitive tutoring programs developed at Carnegie Mellon, beginning in the 1970s, did more than simply drill students on math problems. Cognitive tutors were able to adapt, presenting harder or easier problems as students learned or stumbled. Today, cognitive tutors teach subjects such as algebra to hundreds of thousands of students every year.
