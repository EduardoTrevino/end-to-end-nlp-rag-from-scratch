Question: What issue is reciprocal rank found to have?

Context: ABSTRACT Across a variety of ranking tasks, researchers use reciprocal rank to measure the effectiveness for users interested in exactly one relevant item. Despite its widespread use, evidence suggests that reciprocal rank is brittle when discriminating between systems. This brittleness, in turn, is compounded in modern evaluation set- tings where current, high-precision systems may be difficult to distinguish. We address the lack of sensitivity of reciprocal rank by introducing and connecting
Despite the widespread use of reciprocal rank, recent evidence suggests that it may brittle when it comes to discriminating between ranking systems [10, 19, 20]. In particular, the low number of unique values of reciprocal rank means that, especially when evaluating multiple highly-performing systems, we are likely to observe tied performance. Voorhees et al. [21] demonstrate that these conditions exist in many modern deep learning benchmarks.
single item. Over the years, reciprocal rank (and less so ESL1) has established itself as a core metric for retrieval [5] and recommendation [4], adopted in situations where there is actually only one relevant item as well as in situations where there are multiple relevant items. Given two rankings, reciprocal rank and ESL1 always agree in terms of which ranking is better. Because of this, we refer to them collectively as the recall level 1 or RL1 metrics.

thanks to the 1948 Thistle, we know that DTD, DU, and PiKA had the top 3 times from the Prelims and advanced to the Finals. We also know that storms moved in right after the Prelims on Friday, creating some concern about whether the Finals would run as scheduled. ANOTHER Controversial Finals. For the second year in a row, there was a major controversy during the finals. Unfortunately, this time we don’t actually know what the controversy was.
between PhiKap, Theta Xi, and Scobell House (Men’s Dorms), but again, Theta Xi won by default, as both PhiKap and Scobell were DQ’d for a Hill 4-5 transition violation (the same problem that DU had).

and the organizations snuck out at midnight to get some practice on the course. Avoiding Controversies. After the controversy of 1947 (which, sadly and as noted above, we don’t have details of), Sweepstakes decided to tighten up the rules to avoid any confusion for Raceday. Of course, we don’t have the rules that were tightened either. We’ll keep digging, and if we find it out, we’ll update this post. On the plus side, 1948 didn’t appear to have any controversies.
