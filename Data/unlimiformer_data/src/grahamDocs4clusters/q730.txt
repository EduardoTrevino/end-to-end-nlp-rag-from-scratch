Question: What time in eastern time was the final application deadline for the PhD program in language and information technology? Give your answer in 12h time format with either an am or pm label.

Context: Series in 2022. Again, this of course says noth- ing about the fundamental limits of language models, and even GPT-2, for example, seems to be able to infer from distributional evidence, that the answer to Is 1900 in the past or in the future? is It is in the past, while the answer to Is 2022 in the past or in the future?, is It is in the future. Obviously, since lan- guage models are not generally trained on time-stamped text, there is a limit to what can be inferred from distributional
The algorithm ﬁnds the partially substituted x-y-z-predicate “A is the start time of meeting 27” so it allocates a marker pair and marks all elements E such that “E is the start time of meeting 27” (again only marking proper elements). This time, it marks {10:30 AM} given that “10:30 AM is the start time of meeting 27” is in the knowledge base. For each marked element E, the rule engine tries substituting E for B in R, so it tries substituting {10:30 AM} for B in R. This substitution does not
