Question: How many scenes were included in the HomeRobot OVMM benchmark?

Context: drive research in this area, we introduce the HomeRobot OVMM benchmark, where an agent navigates household environments to grasp novel objects and place them on target receptacles. HomeRobot has two components: a simulation component, which uses a large and diverse curated object set in new, high-quality multi-room home environments; and a real-world component, providing a software stack for the low-cost Hello Robot Stretch to encourage replication of real-world experiments across labs. We
yearly to assess progress on this challenging problem. Real-world benchmarking will be run as a part of the NeurIPS 2023 HomeRobot OVMM competition [23].

Déjà vu. Much like the prior years, the Tartan didn’t seem too interested with Buggy in 1949. So what we know is that 1949 seems very similar to 1948. Once again, 14 organizations (all 12 fraternities, Dorm Council and Citcom Clan) entered the race, and Prelims were run in 5 heats. The first 4 Heats had 3 buggies each, while the 5th Heat had only 2. Record-Breaking Year. There was little, if any, doubt that a course record would be broken this year. And in fact, each of DTD, PiKA, and KapSig,
1946 – PiKA’s Buggy (from the 1947 Thistle). It didn’t win Design Competition, but it had the best aesthetic design. Prelim Heats and Results. The Prelims were run in 3 heats, with 3 teams in each. The rules initially stated that the winner of each heat would compete in the finals, but it seems that the rules changed to be the three fastest times instead, as the Prelim results printed in the May 7, 1946 Tartan indicate that the Finals was just a rematch of Prelim Heat 1. According to the May 7
Safety is a top priority for teams. All drivers are required to have five pieces of safety gear: mouth guard, goggles, a harness that includes three points of contact to the body of the buggy, gloves and a helmet. And during practice runs and races, flaggers man the course to let drivers know if it's safe to proceed.
