Question: What number do all of the Integrated Innovation Institute classes start with in Summer 2024?

Context: SSBSE 2023 upheld the longstanding tradition of SSBSE by gathering the SBSE community yearly to share and discuss advancements in the ﬁeld. This year, we wel- comed submissions showcasing innovative contributions across all SBSE domains. Speciﬁcally, we received 13 submissions to the main Research track, four to the Repli- cations and Negative Results (RENE)/New Ideas and Emerging Results (NIER) track, six to the SBSE Challenge track, and two to the Hot Off the Press (HOP) track. Each valid
2023a). Remarkably, when integrated with the SELF-ALIGN technique (Sun et al., 2023b), our method enabled the training of a self-aligned AI-assistant agent, namely Dromedary-2, from scratch by only manually crafting 6 exemplars for In-Context Learning (Brown et al., 2020) and a combined total of 31 principles (17 from SELF-ALIGN and 14 for SALMON). Despite its mini- mal human supervision design, our model outperformed the extensively RLHF-trained LLaMA-2- Chat model (Touvron et al., 2023b),

First Non-Greek Orgs. 14 Organizations were entered for Raceday in 1948. They included all 12 fraternities (ATO, Beta, Beta Sigma Rho, DTD, DU, KapSig, PhiKap, PiKA, SAE, SigNu, Tau Delta Phi, and Theta Xi), the Men’s Dorms, and Citcom Clan (the commuters – “Citcom” is short for “CIT Commuter”). Although the Men’s Dorms were permitted to enter as far back as 1928, this is the first year that we have evidence that any organization other than a Greek actually did so. Training started in April,
Déjà vu. Much like the prior years, the Tartan didn’t seem too interested with Buggy in 1949. So what we know is that 1949 seems very similar to 1948. Once again, 14 organizations (all 12 fraternities, Dorm Council and Citcom Clan) entered the race, and Prelims were run in 5 heats. The first 4 Heats had 3 buggies each, while the 5th Heat had only 2. Record-Breaking Year. There was little, if any, doubt that a course record would be broken this year. And in fact, each of DTD, PiKA, and KapSig,

The rules initially stated that the winner of each heat would compete in the finals, but it seems that the rules changed to be the three fastest times instead, as the Prelim results printed in the May 7, 1946 Tartan indicate that the Finals was just a rematch of Prelim Heat 1.

Innovation (MSAII) program is a successor to the M.S. in Biotechnology, Innovation and Computing (MSBIC). It combines a rigorous AI and machine learning curriculum with real-world team experience in identifying an AI market niche and developing a responsive product in cooperation with external stakeholders. The core program, which lasts four semesters and leads to a capstone project, focuses on both intrapreneurship and entrepreneurship, equipping graduates to either begin a startup or develop
