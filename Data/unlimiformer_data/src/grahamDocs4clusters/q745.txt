Question: What was  H. John Heinz III College previously called?

Context: correlation volume between the features extracted by the two encoders as described in Sec. III-A. The correlation volume is then fed into a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) that iteratively refines the estimated flow map. Each iteration i of the GRU update outputs a flow update ∆fi, which is added to the previous flow estimate fi−1 to obtain the updated flow map fi. Following [30], we employ an additional context encoder that extracts features only from the LiDAR BEV image, which is additionally fed

It’s a 100-year love of creation and collaboration,” said Olivia Keller at dawn on the inaugural morning practice — called first rolls — in late September. “That the alumni network can be so involved, that they continue to be passionate about buggy long after they’ve gone is very telling of how amazing and special buggy is. It’s part of the CMU experience,” said the senior chemical engineering major, pusher and chair of this year’s Kappa Kappa Gamma and Kappa
