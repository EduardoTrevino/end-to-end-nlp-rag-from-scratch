Question: What is included in the ACL 60/60 evaluation dataset?

Context: We test our system using datasets from different language pairs. Test datasets includes:

Test data from the IWSLT shared task (tst19, tst20) (Anastasopoulos et al., 2021, 2022), where the domain is TED talks.

In the multilingual track, the testing condition is scientific conference talks. Therefore, we primarily rely on the ACL development (dev) set (Salesky et al., 2023) for validation. It consists of English transcripts of the talks and translations into the 10 target languages. The systems are then evaluated on a blind test set. The dev and test sets consist of 5 talks each. The paper abstracts for all talks are available in English. The talks are pre-segmented. In all experiments, we use the

But a few of the specific rules changed slightly, or are worth noting again: All drivers, pushers, designers and builders were required to members of the organization they’re competing for All team members (including designers and builders) must be “eligible” under the Executive Board’s requirements, which include a minimum of 36 units and being in good academic standing (with a minimum GPA requirement). The buggy/driver combo must weigh a minimum of 180 pounds (up from the previous 160 lbs)
1949 – KapSig’s buggy with front hatch removed, being inspected (from the 1950 Thistle).

1949 – PiKA’s Buggy and team (from the 1950 Thistle)

1949 – ATO’s buggy (from the 1950 Thistle). The buggy is flat and white, and has side view mirrors!

1949 – KapSig’s buggy being pushed on the Back Hills (from the 1949 Thistle)

1949 – PiKA’s Buggy (from the 1950 Thistle)
Safety is a top priority for teams. All drivers are required to have five pieces of safety gear: mouth guard, goggles, a harness that includes three points of contact to the body of the buggy, gloves and a helmet. And during practice runs and races, flaggers man the course to let drivers know if it's safe to proceed.
