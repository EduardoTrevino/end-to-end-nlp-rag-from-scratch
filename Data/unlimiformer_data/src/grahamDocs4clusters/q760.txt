Question: What computation is offloaded to a k-nearest-neighbor (kNN) index in the Unlimiformer approach?

Context: Since the proposal of transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017), these models have been limited to bounded input lengths, because of their need to attend to every token in the input. In this work, we propose Unlimiformer: a general approach that wraps any existing pretrained encoder-decoder transformer, and offloads the cross-attention computation to a single k-nearest-neighbor (kNN) index, while the returned kNN distances are the attention dot-product scores. This kNN index can be kept on either the

Gormley Summary: This work proposes Unlimiformer: a general approach that wraps any existing pretrained encoder-decoder transformer, and offloads the cross-attention computation to a single k-nearest-neighbor (kNN) index, while the returned kNN distances are the attention dot-product scores.
We introduce Unlimiformer, a retrieval-based approach to augment pretrained language mod- els to accept inputs of unbounded length at test time. Given a long input sequence, Unlimi- former constructs a k-nearest-neighbor (kNN) index over the hidden states of all input tokens. Then, every standard cross-attention head in ev- ery decoder layer queries the kNN index, such that the kNN distances are the attention dot- product scores, and attends only to the top-k input tokens.

Tartan, Heat 1 saw a very tight race between KapSig, DTD, and PiKA, with KapSig winning in 3:24.5, DTD finishing in 3:25.1, and PiKA finishing in 3:26.3. Those were the top 3 times and they advanced to the finals. Prelim Heat 2 paired Beta, SAE, and DU, and SAE won the heat by default, as Beta was DQ’d for a pushbar violation and DU was DQ’d for a Hill 4-5 transition violation (the Tartan reports that they “shoved the buggy into the last zone instead of pushing it”). Prelims Heat 3 was a battle

20. Kidney donor matching, 2008 Organ transplants save lives every day, but more people could likely be saved if it was easier to match recipients with donors who are unrelated. An algorithm developed by CMU scientists is close to enabling a nationwide network that would match living kidney donors with potential recipients whom they've never met in real life.
