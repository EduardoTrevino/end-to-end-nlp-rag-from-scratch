Question: What is the novel architecture introduced in the paper "Efficient Sequence Transduction by Jointly Predicting Tokens and Durations"?

Context: maintain dimensions that are congruent with GPT- 3 models. Additionally, all of our models are trained to handle a maximum sequence length of 2,048 tokens. The detailed architecture is shown in Table 4. Alibi [28]. Alibi introduces a more streamlined and efficient positional ap- proach called Attention with Linear Biases. Rather than adding positional em- beddings to word embeddings, ALiBi applies a bias to query-key attention scores, penalizing them based on their distance. SwiGLU [32]. SwiGLU
Paper title: 'Exploration of Efficient End-to-End ASR using Discretized Input from Self-Supervised Learning' Published year: 2023 Publication venue or conference: Interspeech Authors: Xuankai Chang, Yuya Fujita, Takashi Maekaku, Shinji Watanabe, Brian Yan Summary: This paper proposes a new protocol that utilizes discretized token sequences in ASR tasks, which includes de-duplication and sub-word modeling to enhance the input sequence and reduces computational cost by decreasing the length of
While this rate is efficient in most cases, we can further im- prove computational efficiency by removing repeated tokens and applying subword modeling. In [29], consecutively re- peated discrete tokens are combined into a single token. Sub- word modeling, originally proposed in [36, 37] to address the open vocabulary problem in text, was applied to discrete speech tokens from vector-quantization [30] to reduce time resolution by identifying and grouping frequently occurring patterns as a

Title: Optimizing Compilers for Modern Architectures
Transition: Procedure whereby one pusher finishes pushing a buggy and the next pusher in sequence starts to push that same buggy.
Since the first Campus Week in 1920, when “chariots” were built to race around campus, student groups have been working year-round, using their engineering skills, design expertise and penchant for interdisciplinary collaboration to secretly build, modify and refine the most aerodynamic, torpedo-like vessel they call a “buggy.”

The rules initially stated that the winner of each heat would compete in the finals, but it seems that the rules changed to be the three fastest times instead, as the Prelim results printed in the May 7, 1946 Tartan indicate that the Finals was just a rematch of Prelim Heat 1.
