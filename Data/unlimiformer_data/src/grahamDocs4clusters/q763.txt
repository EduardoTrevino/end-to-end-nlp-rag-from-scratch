Question: What is the effect of training speakers with a highly weighted ToM listener component?

Context: (2021), we build language-learning agents equipped with ToM, and measure its effects on the learning process. We model ToM by giving the speaker agent an internal listener model that is trained alongside the speaker and used to rerank potential utterances. We experiment with varying task difﬁculty, hy- pothesizing that models will acquire more complex language to adapt to stronger environmental pressures. We ﬁnd that training speakers with a highly weighted ToM listener component leads to
Paper title: 'Computational Language Acquisition with Theory of Mind' Published year: 2023 Publication venue or conference: International Conference on Learning Representations Authors: Hao Zhu, Graham Neubig, Yonatan Bisk, Andy T. Liu, Emmy Liu Summary: It is found that training speakers with a highly weighted ToM listener component leads to performance gains in the authors' image referential game setting, and suggests the potential utility of further incorporating ToM, as well as other
We also ﬁnd that the usage of a highly-weighted ToM listener leads to signiﬁcant ﬂuency gains when training on both easy (15.6% relative increase in ﬂuency score) and hard (11.6%) distractors. We also see longer and more complex utterances when using normally or highly weighted ToM listeners. Additionally, we ﬁnd limited gains in general captioning ability between baseline and high-weight models, as measured by BLEU score. However, these effects are more subtle, and do not always lead to

First “Broadcast”. 1948 is the first indication that we have of a “broadcast” on Raceday. According to the May 18, 1948 Tartan, a jeep patrolled the course and carried both the starter and a PA system, allowing the occupants of the vehicle to broadcast the race to the spectators on the course (as long as you were in range to hear the PA
