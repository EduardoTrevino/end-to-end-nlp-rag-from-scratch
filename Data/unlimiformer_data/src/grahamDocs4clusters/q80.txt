Question: In spring 2024, What is the deadline for adding or dropping a Mini-4 course with tuition adjustment?

Context: Mini GPT-4 [Zhu et al., 2023] uses a pretrained Q-Former module from [Li et al., 2023] to project images encoded by EVA CLIP ViT-G/14 [Fang et al., 2022] to Vicuna’s [Chiang et al., 2023] text embedding space. Both CLIP and Vicuna are frozen, while a section of the Q-former is finetuned on a subset of LAION [Schuhmann et al., 2021], Conceptual Captions [Sharma et al., 2018], SBU [Ordonez et al., 2011], and multimodal instruction-following data generated by the authors.

A SOURCE OF MULTIMODAL HALLUCINATION
The details of the training process are as follows. We started ﬁne-tuning the mT5, by mini- mizing the maximum-likelihood loss for 15 epochs, using a batch size of 8, accumulation steps of 4, and learning rate of 10e-5 with Adafactor optimization and cosine annealing learning rate decay schedule (Loshchilov and Hutter 2016). The maximum news length was set to 512 and max- imum summary length was determined as 120. We initialized our reinforcement learning models with the ﬁne-tuned models that

The Finals, initially scheduled for 2pm on Saturday, May 4, were ultimately postponed until Saturday, May 11, due to a downpour that cast a damper on an otherwise exciting Spring Carnival. Controversial Finals. An overcast sky threatened rain on the makeup date as well, though it held off long enough for the race to be run. But some of the spectators may have wished the rain came sooner. Although signs were posted about the makeup date, cars ignored the notices and ended up blocking part of the
Fight Over Carnival Schedule. Now that Spring Carnival was back on, the students had to decide how they wanted it – As 2 days in May (losing a day of vacation) or one day in April (not sacrificing any other off days). Buggy was going to happen either way, but ultimately the students voted on a 2 day Carnival, keeping the tradition intact and putting Raceday on the schedule for May 2-3. Time Trials. It looks like this post-war period was when the race changed from a head-to-head to a time trial.
