We begin with the ACL Anthology and focus on papers between 1980 and 2022. Using the Semantic- Scholar (S2) API (Wade, 2022), we obtain author and citation information of papers indexed by S2 (some venues, such as some workshops, and some Findings8 papers, are not indexed, leaving 77, 235 papers), with a focus on citations of papers identified by our participants as having been influential to the NLP community. We select from this set of influential papers to generate the bar plots for Figure

Depending on Friday and Saturday's conditions, most heats may run just two lanes instead of three. But still, despite some of the challenges, Chen said she wouldn't miss it.

"Being a driver is really fun," Chen said. "I love going fast and going around the course."
This year Fringe is planning to roll four different vehicles, built and maintained in the Fringe workshop in the basement of the East Campus Garage, known as the "Froom."

"We're used to saying everything with 'fr' in front of it but when we say something in front of other people, it gets them confused," said Fringe head mechanic Dave Singh, who will graduate in May with a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering and biomedical engineering.
Fairings have been a key feature for the Fringe team in recent years, which is celebrating its 50th anniversary of Buggy.

"We have a reputation of being the quietest on the course," said Diya Nuxoll, who wrapped up her bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering in December and is working on an advanced studies master's degree in design and manufacturing. Nuxoll leads the Fringe team as one of two head mechanics.
