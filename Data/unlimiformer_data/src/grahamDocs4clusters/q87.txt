Context: repositories from The Stack v1.1. After the cut-off date (31 October 2022), we have received more requests for requests and we will remove these repositories prior to releasing The Stack v1.2.
Developers who do not wish their source code to be used for training code LLMs are given the op- portunity to opt-out of The Stack (Kocetkov et al., 2022).

Controversial Finals. An overcast sky threatened rain on the makeup date as well, though it held off long enough for the race to be run.
