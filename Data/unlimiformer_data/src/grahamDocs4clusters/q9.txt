Question: What class room was advanced NLP taught last semester?

Context: Andrew Caines, Helen Yannakoudakis, Helena Edmond- son, Helen Allen, Pascual Pérez-Paredes, Bill Byrne, and Paula Buttery. 2020. The teacher-student chat- room corpus. In Proceedings of the 9th Workshop on NLP for Computer Assisted Language Learning, pages 10–20.
▶ Proposition 23. The classes coLP and NLP are incomparable, even when restricted to graphs of bounded structural degree. More precisely, coLP|graph(∆) (cid:1)(cid:1)⋚ NLP|graph(∆) for all ∆ ≥ 3, and a fortiori coLP (cid:1)(cid:1)⋚ NLP.
Lower barriers Beyond time saved (re-) imple- menting methods, many participants identified a lower barrier to entry into the field as a notable ben- efit of centralization on specific software infrastruc- ture. Participants described students getting state of the art results within an hour of tackling a problem; seeing the average startup time for new students decreasing from six months to a few weeks; and teaching students with no computer science back- ground to build NLP applications with

Fairings have been a key feature for the Fringe team in recent years, which is celebrating its 50th anniversary of Buggy.

"We have a reputation of being the quietest on the course," said Diya Nuxoll, who wrapped up her bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering in December and is working on an advanced studies master's degree in design and manufacturing. Nuxoll leads the Fringe team as one of two head mechanics.
Tishya Girdhar, a junior in neuroscience, is social chair for Fringe. She came to CMU wanting to drive, but first she had to get over being claustrophobic. She started as a mechanic and got behind the wheel for last year's Sweepstakes.

"Our team's philosophy is to teach everyone how to do everything," Girdhar said. "But I came to CMU wanting to drive. I wanted to drive so badly."
between PhiKap, Theta Xi, and Scobell House (Men’s Dorms), but again, Theta Xi won by default, as both PhiKap and Scobell were DQ’d for a Hill 4-5 transition violation (the same problem that DU had). Rain or Shine, But Not Really… One other rule stated that the race would be rain-or-shine. However, that didn’t turn out to be true.
