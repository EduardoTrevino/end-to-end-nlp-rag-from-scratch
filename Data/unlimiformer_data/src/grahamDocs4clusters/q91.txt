Question: How many authors are on the SENTECON paper?

Context: Paper title: 'SenteCon: Leveraging Lexicons to Learn Human-Interpretable Language Representations' Published year: 2023 Publication venue or conference: Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics Authors: Victoria Lin, Louis-Philippe Morency Summary: This work presents SenteCon, a method for introducing human interpretability in deep language representations that outperforms existing interpretable language representations with respect to both its downstream performance and
We present an alternative view of data, similar to that seen in Figure 1, in Figure 4. Here, we define members of the community as authors with at least three papers total in *CL venues. Authors are counted as “leaving” the community the year after their last *CL publication. We only consider trends in authorship until 2020, as it is difficult to determine if authors who did not publish in the last few years have left the community indefinitely.
Figure 1: The number of unique researchers publishing in ACL venues has increased dramatically, from 715 unique authors in 1980 to 17,829 in 2022.

Once again, 14 organizations (all 12 fraternities, Dorm Council and Citcom Clan) entered the race, and Prelims were run in 5 heats. The first 4 Heats had 3 buggies each, while the 5th Heat had only 2. Record-Breaking Year. There was little, if any, doubt that a course record would be broken this year. And in fact, each of DTD, PiKA, and KapSig,
First Non-Greek Orgs. 14 Organizations were entered for Raceday in 1948. They included all 12 fraternities (ATO, Beta, Beta Sigma Rho, DTD, DU, KapSig, PhiKap, PiKA, SAE, SigNu, Tau Delta Phi, and Theta Xi), the Men’s Dorms, and Citcom Clan (the commuters – “Citcom” is short for “CIT Commuter”).
