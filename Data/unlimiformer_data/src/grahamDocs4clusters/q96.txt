Question: What does A-LoL use to filter negative advantage (low-quality) data points during training?

Context: incorporating sequence-level classifiers or human-designed scoring functions as rewards. Subsequently, by using LM’s internal sequence-level value estimate, A-LOL filters negative advantage (low-quality) data points during training, making it resilient to noise. Overall, A-LOL is an easy-to-implement LM training recipe that is sample-efficient and stable. We demonstrate the effectiveness of A-LOL and its variants with a set of four different language generation tasks. We compare against both
Overall, A-LOL and its variants consistently achieve high average reward with relatively low variance, even after discarding ≈33% of training data points. Further qualitative analysis reveals that the lowest negative advantage instances often indicate bad quality data (Appendix B.4). A-LOL methods perform comparably to DPO and outperform all other preference-based and reward-based baselines while generating the most diverse responses. Interestingly, A-LOL seq. (that uses a per-token importance
Surprisingly, the LMs trained on downvoted data with A-LOL almost close the gap with their counterparts trained on upvoted data. Upon closer inspection, we find that about 36% of upvoted replies and 48% of the downvoted replies in their respective training sets received a negative advantage and thus, were never sampled when finetuning with A-LOL. By filtering the unfavorable data points, A-LOL extracts the useful training signal even from suboptimal data. We called our method Leftover Lunch RL

Title: EX-CHANGE: Exhibition & Publication in Practice
Fairings have been a key feature for the Fringe team in recent years, which is celebrating its 50th anniversary of Buggy.

"We have a reputation of being the quietest on the course," said Diya Nuxoll, who wrapped up her bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering in December and is working on an advanced studies master's degree in design and manufacturing. Nuxoll leads the Fringe team as one of two head mechanics.
Fringe vehicles often are named with the letter "B," like Boson, Blueshift, Bissa and Bumper. Other teams, such as Apex, often use names that connotate fire, while the SDC (Student Dormitory Committee) team, uses names such as Vice, Bane, Avarice and Malice.

This year's buggy names will be under wraps until Thursday, when the Buggy Showcase will take place from noon to 2 p.m. in Weigand Gymnasium in the Cohon University Center. It's one of the few times spectators can see buggies up close.
Beta’s new design was the winner of the first post-war Design Competition. The buggy, designed by Rick Saxton, was shaped like a bug with welded tubular steel. The real design battle seemed to be between Beta and PiKA, and the Tartan noted that PiKA’s buggy had a better appearance. However, Beta’s was structurally superior and that allowed it to take home the design trophy.

The LTI discourages Leaves of Absence (LOA) since students usually do not return, despite

having good intentions. However,  a student in good standing may  be granted a LOA of at most

one year, upon written request to the MSAII Dire ctor and with the consent of the student's

advisor. It is the responsibility of  the student on LOA to contact th e LTI to initiate a return to
