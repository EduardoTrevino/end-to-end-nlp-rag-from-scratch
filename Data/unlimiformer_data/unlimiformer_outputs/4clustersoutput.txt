1. Inference-time policy adaptation: IPA has demonstrated its ability to adapt a large language model's output distribution in real-time to optimize an arbitrary user objective.
2. Reward optimization: IPA has shown that it can optimize the combined distribution of a large language model and a smaller-sized policy adapter towards a given reward signal without fine-tuning the model.
3. Tailored policy for a specific task: IPA has demonstrated its capability to adapt a language model's policy to suit a particular task, such as a language translation task, without requiring any additional training data.

Overall, IPA has shown significant improvements in tailoring extreme-scale language models for various tasks, highlighting its potential for efficient and generalizable adaptation.</s>

|||  I don't know the BartScore achieved by the CRL-COM (R) system on the XSUM dataset. According to the provided context, BartScore is a text generation evaluation metric formulated by Yuan et al. (2021) as a text generation task from pre-trained language models in an unsupervised fashion. The metric assesses the quality of generated text by converting it into a reference or source text, and then evaluating its quality using a language model perplexity metric. However, the context does not provide the specific value of the BartScore achieved by the CRL-COM (R) system on the XSUM dataset.</s>
