Bacterial brown stripe disease caused by Acidovorax oryzae is a major threat to
crop yields, and the current reliance on pesticides for control is unsustainable
due to environmental pollution and resistance. To address this, bacterial-based
ligands have been explored as a potential treatment solution. In this study, we
developed a protein –protein interaction (PPI) network for A. oryzae by utilizing
shared differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and the STRING database. Using a
maximal clique centrality (MCC) approach through CytoHubba and Network
Analyzer, we identi ﬁed hub genes within the PPI network. We then analyzed the
genomic data of the top 10 proteins, and further narrowed them down to 2
proteins by utilizing betweenness, closeness, degree, and eigenvector studies.
Finally, we used molecular docking to screen 100 compounds against the ﬁnal
two proteins (guaA and metG), and Enfumafungin was selected as a potential
treatment for bacterial resistance caused by A. oryzae based on their binding
afﬁnity and interaction energy. Our approach demonstrates the potential of
utilizing bioinformatics and molecular docking to identify novel drug candidates
for precision treatment of bacterial brown stripe disease caused by A. oryzae ,
paving the way for more targeted and sustainable control strategies. The ef ﬁcacy
of Enfumafungin in inhibiting the growth of A. oryzae strain RS-1 was investigated
through both computational and wet lab methods. The models of the protein
were built using the Swiss model, and their accuracy was con ﬁrmed via a
Ramachandran plot. Additionally, Enfumafungin demonstrated potent
inhibitory action against the bacter ial strain, with an MIC of 100 µg/mL,
reducing OD 600values by up to 91%. The effectiveness of Enfumafungin was
further evidenced through agar well diffusion assays, which exhibited the highest
zone of inhibition at 1.42 cm when the concentration of Enfumafungin was at
100 µg/mL. Moreover, Enfumafungin was also able to effectively reduce the
bioﬁlm of A. oryzae RS-1 in a concentration-dependent manner. The swarming

1 Introduction
Numerous crops are affected by the Gram-negative bacterium
Acidovorax oryzae . Sugarcane, rice, maize, oats, sorghum, and
millet are among the several crops impacted by this bacterium.
Contaminated seeds are the most important source of inoculum
and a mechanism for transmitting this bacterium to new plants and
causing an outbreak ( Song et al., 2004 ). Knowing the molecular
basis for the infection of A. oryzae is important since bacterial
brown stripe (BBS) has signi ﬁcant commercial value, due to which
it has gained increasing attention in China ( Xie et al., 2011 ;Li et al.,
2015 ). Bactericidal agents are mostly used currently to prevent and
manage bacterial infections. O wing to severe environmental
pollution and bacterial resistance brought on by the excessive use
of pesticides in countries that cultivate rice, it has become more
important than ever to develop novel prevention and control
strategies ( Laxminarayan et al., 2013 ).
To address the challenges of dr ug resistance, alternative
approaches such as drug repurposing have emerged as promising
strategies ( An et al., 2023 ). This method of drug repurposing mostly
consists of computational strategies that are mostly based on
transcriptional signatures, targets, networks, machine learning,structures using chemogenomics, and techniques in molecular
docking ( March-Vila et al., 2017 ). While drug repurposing has
several advantages, it also has limitations that can affect its success.
One such limitation is the unexpected outcome of interactions
between the target and repurposed drug, often due to differences in
the active sites where the drug acts. The structure –activity
relationship may differ between the original and repurposed drugs
due to variations in biochemical targets, rendering some repurposed
drugs ineffective. However, the effectiveness of repurposed drugs
has been demonstrated when used in combination with other
medications, making this strategy a strong contender for
leveraging the existing pharmacopeia for new therapeutic uses
(Aube ́, 2012 ).
The repurposing of drugs against bacteria through a network-
based approach requires the protein interaction networks for these
bacteria to be computationally analyzed ( Pan et al., 2016 ). Because
of the continuous spread of antimicrobial resistance, ﬁnding new
potential therapeutic targets, which are based on their biological
process, has become the need of the hour. In order to discover
potential therapeutic targets, a comparative genomics study couldbe conducted using various genome database resources and
software tools. These resources and tools can help identify genes
and proteins that are crucial for the survival, growth, and important
functions of pathogens within the host. By analyzing this
information, researchers can gain insight into potential targets for
therapeutic intervention. By conducting a comparative genomics
study between host and pathogen, it is possible to ﬁlter out
homologs in order to avoid potential toxic and side effects of
newly designed drugs on the host. This approach can increase the
success rate of drug design by ensuring that the drugs target the
pathogen without harming the host ( Sheikh, 2010 ;Sekyere and
Asante, 2018 ).
Various circumstances where a pathogenic variant is associated
with a disease in non-coding regions are dif ﬁcult to target, which
further limits the number of associations that are candidates for
drugs development. Combining data from multiple biological
networks and pathway databases can broaden the number of
potential targets and increase association numbers that lead to
effective treatments. Traditionally, target discovery has relied only
on wet lab experiments, which involve highly expensive, unreliable,
and time-consuming processes. With the development of
bioinformatics and chemical informatics, multiple omics-based in
silico therapeutic target discovery methods (computer-aided drug
designing) have come to the fore ( Katsila et al., 2016 ;Shanmugam
and Jeon, 2017 ;Wooller et al., 2017 ). Integration of computer-aided
therapeutic target discovery with big data containing omics-based
data greatly shortens the time required for drug discovery and
development cycle, and the scope of experimental targets, and
minimizes the experimental cost ( Dai and Zhao, 2015 ;
Shanmugam and Jeon, 2017 ). The two main existing classes of in
silico methods for potential therapeutic target identi ﬁcation are
comparative genomics and network-based methods, while the
important features that differentiate these two methods from one
another are network-based approaches that can be used in
infectious diseases as well as in non-infectious diseases. On the
other hand, comparative genomics is only used for infectious
diseases ( Csermely et al., 2013 ;Rangel-Vega et al., 2015 ).
However, these two different methods often complement each
other in their advantages and disadvantages ( Zhang et al., 2021 ).
The ligand-based approach of drug repurposing uses a combination
of the chemical moieties of individually approved and
marketed drugs.Khattak et al. 10.3389/fcimb.2023.1225285
Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology frontiersin.org 02To address the unrelenting need for improved treatment
alternatives for BBS disease, here we have used a combination of
bacterial-based ligands, which were previously shown to be better
inhibitors against multiple bacteria and fungus. In short, we have
screened drugs using molecular docking, to propose Enfumafungin
as a drug candidate against plausible bacterial resistance caused by
A. oryzae . We are optimistic that using such molecular targets
might help us overcome the rapidly growing antibiotic resistance in
theOryza sativa , with the help of rational development of effective
drugs against BBS disease in the future. Furthermore, our
combined-moiety ligand-based molecular docking approach via
indispensable targets will likely provide new opportunities of drug
repurposing for drug-resistant BBS.
2 Materials and methods
The genomic data and bacterial strain of A. oryzae were
collected from Plant Bacteriology Laboratory, Zhejiang University,
PR China. The bacterial strain was normally grown in Luria-Bertani
(LB) medium consisting of 5 g of yeast extract, 10 g of NaCl, 10 g of
tryptone, and 1,000 mL of ddH 2O with/without 15 g to 20 g agar,
pH 7.0, at 30°C as described by Masum et al. (2019) .
2.1 Details about datasets and literature
One of the major bacterial pathogens of rice, A. oryzae , the
causative agent of BBS, was selected in this study. The genomic data
of the top 10 proteins were selected on the basis of genome analysis
of the bacterial strain. Betwee nness, closeness, degree, and
eigenvector studies further narrow down our selection from 10
proteins to 2 proteins. The proteins we have chosen for our study
were compared with the already available published data, and it wasfound that both proteins are crucial for conducting this study.
Similarly, in order to con ﬁrm that the dataset we have chosen is
valid or not, it was compared with the already available datasets and
was found appropriate for our study. For further study, the dataset
wasﬁltered to ﬁnd those with the least bias and noise. Both the case
sample and control sample were present in the datasets and
logarithmic modi ﬁcation was performed to reduce the impact of
outliers and approximate normalcy.
2.2 Protein –protein interaction
network analysis
Using all the shared differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of the
A. oryzae ,ap r o t e i n –protein interaction (PPI) network was
developed with the help of the STRING database ( Szklarczyk
et al., 2016 ). Setting up a pathway generally starts with a signaling
molecule stimulating a speci ﬁc receptor molecule, which further
initiates a cascade of PPIs. Understanding this PPI is considered as a
prerequisite for drug development and systems biology. The study
of PPI networks helps us understand a lot complex biological
processes. To obtain primary data about the PPI networks, thewhole genome was uploaded in STRING Version 11.5 for the PPI
network and functional enrichment analysis ( Abadio et al., 2011 ;
Hosen et al., 2014 ).
2.3 Interactome construction and analysis
Genes and gene connections with one another makes the PPI
network. The tightly linked and most entangled node within a
network is known as hub genes. The hub genes are determined
through a maximal clique centrality (MCC) topological approach.
To apply the MCC algorithm to the PPI network, CytoHubba was
used. CytoHubba is basically a Cytoscape software plugin ( http://
apps.cytoscape.org/apps/cytohubba ). The Cytoscape software
plugin includes 11 topological algorithms for ranking nodes in a
network ( Hosen et al., 2014 ;Ali et al., 2020 ).
CYTOSCAPE version 2.8.2 was used for viewing the networks
of protein already mentioned above. The NETWORK ANALYZER
plug-in was used to analyze networks and the values of network
centrality parameters such as closeness centrality (CC), betweenness
centrality (BC), and degree centrality (DC). Gephi 0.8.2-beta was
used to calculate the important measure of eigenvector centrality
(EC). In order to categorize the top-ranked proteins/hubs in the
network of important identi ﬁed genes, the Java plug-in CytoHubba
was used ( Szklarczyk et al., 2019 ). Combined scores were taken
from different parameters considered in STRING as edge weights
for computing CytoHubba scores. Multiple topological algorithms
such as Maximum Neighborhood Component (MNC), Maximal
Clique Centrality (MCC), and Density of Maximum Neighborhood
Component (DMNC) were used for ﬁnding important hub proteins
in the AS and AST network.
2.4 Homology modeling and structure
validation of the selected proteins
A structured model was created for both proteins guaA and
metG through https://swissmodel.expasy.org/ ; i.e., protein
sequences of both guaA and metG were submitted to https://
swissmodel.expasy.org/ for structure prediction. Protein ID
7zu9.1.A was identi ﬁed as a template for structure prediction for
guaA and protein ID 6wq6.1.A was identi ﬁed as a template for
structure prediction for metG. Both the structures were validated
through a Ramachandran plot ( Arnold et al., 2006 ;Bordoli et al.,
2009 ;Sobolev et al., 2020 ).
2.5 Binding site identi ﬁcation for virtual
screening and docking
To prepare the selected protein for binding study, the ﬁrst step
was to identify its binding pockets using the CASTp server, which
provides information about the protein ’s surface topology. Once the
binding pockets were identi ﬁed, AutoDock v4.2 was used to create a
grid box and map ﬁles for docking. The grid box coordinates,
speciﬁcally X,Y, and Z, were saved in a grid parameter ﬁle (GPF) forKhattak et al. 10.3389/fcimb.2023.1225285
Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology frontiersin.org 03future use. As the active site of protein is unknown, we followed a
blind docking approach by enclosing the whole protein inside the
grid ( Ghersi and Sanchez, 2009 ). We used MGLTools v1.5.7 to
execute GPF ﬁles and generate map ﬁles for docking purposes. After
executing GPF ﬁles, we generated Grid log ﬁles (GLG) that
contained all the atomic map ﬁles to be used as input parameters
for docking. The program AU-TOGRID calculated the docking
(Rizvi et al., 2013 ;Ramachandran et al., 2022 ).
2.6 Ligand screening
Virtual screening was used to identify small molecules that are
most likely to bind to a target protein; ligand screening was
performed with the help of Auto dock Vina ( Li et al., 2019 ). Perl
script was used to screen multiple ligands for selected proteins.
Almost 100 different natural antimicrobial volatile organic
compounds from multiple microbial and fungal isolates were
selected for this study and are listed in Supplementary Table 1 ;
they were screened to ﬁnd out the best docked compounds. The 3D
SDF structures for docking and screening purposes were obtained
from PubChem ( https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ ).
2.7 Protein ligand docking studies
Individual dockings were performed for guaA and metG against
the top ﬁve ligands with high docking af ﬁnity and lower RMSD
score. At the end of the docking process, the pose with the highest
binding energy was chosen from the total conformations, and for
each docking process, the binding orientations were analyzed. The
docking studies were performe d using Lamarckian Genetic
Algorithm (LGA) ( Morris et al., 2009 ). All the structural ﬁgures
are generated using discovery studio 2021 ( Pettersen et al., 2004 ).
Virtual screening results were visually analyzed and the top ligand
with a high docking af ﬁnity and a lower RMSD score was selected
for docking purposes. Docking was performed with the help of
AutoDock 4.2. The Genetic Algorithm parameter was selected for
docking, while the minimum GA runs were set to be 50 and the
population size was set to be 300 ( Khattak et al., 2023 ). The number
of evals was set to be 2,500,000 for 0 to 10 torsion angles, while it
was set to be 250,000,000 for more than 10 torsion angles. The
output was selected as Lamarckian GA.
2.8 Agar well diffusion assay
According to the methods of Elbeshehy et al. (2015) ,t h e
antibacterial activity and inhibitory action of AgNPs were studied
against the A. oryzae RS-1. A. oryzae RS-1 overnight culture of 200
mL(∼1×1 08CFU/mL) after being combined with 5 mL of half-
strength LB medium was dispersed throughout an LB plate
containing solid medium. The medium was air-dried ﬁrst and
then different doses of Enfumafungin (25, 50, and 100 mg/mL)
were added evenly apart on the agar surface of the media plate andincubated at 30°C for 24 h. Finally, the diameter of the inhibition
zone surrounding the wells was measured.
2.9 Minimum inhibitory concentration
A 96-well microtiter plate was used for the experiment of the
minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). In order to evaluate the
MIC of Enfumafungin, 50 µL of bacterium cells from the A. oryzae
RS-1 (1×108CFU/mL) was inoculated into Enfumafungin solution
of different concentrations and various doses, with sterile DMSO
serving as the control. Following that, the samples were incubated
for 12 h at 30°C at 180 rpm. Using a Thermo Multiskan EX
Microplate Photometer, the absorbance value at 600 nm was read
to determine the quantity of bacteria present in the samples
(Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁc Inc., Waltham, MA). This experiment
was conducted three times with three replicates for each treatment.
2.10 Swarming and motility
LB plates containing 0.7% (w/v) agar were used to test the effect
of Enfumafungin on A. oryzae RS-1 swarming motility. A semisolid
LB agar plate containing 200 mg/mL Enfumafungin was loaded with
5mL of overnight-cultured A. oryzae RS-1, while the plate devoid of
Enfumafungin served as the control. The plates were then incubated
at 30°C for 3 days. The colony diameter of strain RS-1 was assessed
to quantify swarming motility, and the experiment was performed
three times ( Dong et al., 2016 ).
2.11 Live/dead cell staining
The live/dead staining approach was employed to determine
whether the membrane of bacterial cells treated with Enfumafungin
had been damaged or left undamaged according to the method
developed by Ali et al. (2020) , This was done by using the Invitrogen
BacLight bacterial viability kit. Live bacteria were utilized as a
positive control according to the kit ’s protocol, and samples of
dead bacteria that had been treated with isopropanol were used as a
negative control. In order to treat bacterial cells independently as a
positive control, negative control, and Enfumafungin treated, they
were divided into three tubes, each of which contained 1 mL of
bacterial cells. Fluorescence in the sample was detected using the
Olympus inverted confocal microscope ( Ali et al., 2020 ).
2.12 Bio ﬁlm inhibition assay
The ef ﬁcacy of Enfumafungin to suppress the bio ﬁlm formation
of Ao strain RS-1 was investigated using 96-well microtiter culture
plates ( Masum et al., 2018 ).A. oryzae strain RS-1 was cultured in LB
broth until mid-exponential phase ( ∼1×1 08CFU/mL), and then
100mL of bacterial culture with Enfumafungin at concentrations of
50 and 100 mg/mL were poured into each well. Sterile DMSO wasKhattak et al. 10.3389/fcimb.2023.1225285
Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology frontiersin.org 04applied as a control in place of Enfumafungin. For 24 h, the plates
were held in static phase at 30°C, and after bacterial culture was
disposed of, the 96-well plate was brie ﬂy rinsed with sterile ddH 2O
and dried for 24 h. The attached bio ﬁlm material was stained with
100mL of 1% crystal violet (CV) solution and incubated at room
temperature for 30 –45 min. A SPECTRAmax ®PLUS384
Microplate Spectrophotometer was then used to measure the
absorbance at 570 nm of the leftover CV-stained solution after it
had been solubilized with 200 mL of 33% acetic acid. The
experiment was repeated three times while six replicates of each
treatment were used.
2.13 Bacterial cell morphology
observation using TEM
To prepare for TEM analysis, 1 mL of the Ao strain RS-1
bacterium (at approximately 1 × 108CFU/mL) was mixed with
Enfumafungin to a ﬁnal concentration of 50 mg/mL. The mixture
served as the test sample, while the bacteria suspension without
Enfumafungin served as the control. The bacteria were incubated in
a shaker at 160 rpm and 30°C for 8 h. Afterwards, the bacterial cells
were washed with 0.1 M PBS and ﬁxed onto a glass slide with 2.5%
glutaraldehyde. The samples were then dehydrated using a series of
ethanol solutions at increasing concentrations (50%, 70%, 80%,
90%, 95%, and 100%) before being observed through TEM.
2.14 Statistical analysis
The experimental data were analyzed by IBM SPSS statistics
version 23 for Windows software (SPSS Inc) and GraphPad Prism
7.00. The data represented show the average value with standard
error of minimum three values of each independent experimentusing one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), Duncan ’s test, and
Student ’st-test to determine any signi ﬁcant differences between
groups at p< 0.05.
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Genome analysis (Cytoscape
network analysis)
Gene expression analysis utilizing microarray and RNA-seq
datasets is considered to be sensitive for global gene expression
investigations and ﬁnding probable molecular pathways that are
activated in bacterial cells. We have studied and analyzed the
genome analysis of bacterial strain A. oryzae , the causative agent
of BBS. All the genes in the genome containing more than 2,500
individual genes were analyzed and the top 10 proteins of bacterial
genome were selected for total pr otein analysis. These target
proteins were selected on a range of basis, including closeness,
entry, entry point, review status, protein type, and length of
the proteins.3.2 Features of the interactomes
A separate interactome of all bacterial protein was ﬁrst
constructed, which consists of all bacterial proteins and their
interaction partners from the STRING (version 9.0) database.
Furthermore, an integrated picture containing all the proteins and
their connected partner proteins was taken into account to focus on
the most indispensable proteins of the extremely complex
phenotype. STRING is a comprehensive database that combines
physical and functional interactions between proteins, utilizing
various experimental and computational methods as well aspublic text collections. As it incorporates existing empirical and
theoretical ﬁndings, it is possible that the network being analyzed
may appear random ( Morris et al., 1998 ) or exhibit a “small-world ”
topology, where each node has a similar number of connections
(Watts and Strogatz, 1998 ). However, the interactomes in STRING
follow a power law distribution without a characteristic scale,
resulting in a scale-free network with a heavy tail degree
distribution ( Seraﬁno et al., 2020 ). Taken together, the network
and enrichment facilities in S TRING enable comprehensive
characterization of user gene lists and functional genomics
datasets, and allow the creation and sharing of highly customized
and augmented protein –protein association networks ( Szklarczyk
et al., 2021 ). PPIs play a crucial role in in silico drug discovery due to
their signi ﬁcance in various biological processes and the potential
they offer as therapeutic targets. PPIs can offer new opportunities
for identifying novel drug targets. Inhibiting speci ﬁc interactions
can disrupt disease-related pat hways, making them attractive
candidates for drug discovery . Conventional drug targets
(enzymes, receptors, etc.) have limitations. Targeting PPIs allows
researchers to explore a broader range of therapeutic possibilities
(Ran and Gestwicki, 2018 ). The whole data regarding the
information about interactome and STRING database could not
be provided because of the huge amount of data, but the data
regarding the selected proteins ’name, accession numbers, locus,
locus tag, and protein length are provided in Table 1 .
3.3 Top individual proteins and
combined interactomes
The networks constructed in the study were analyzed using four
important concepts in network analysis: DC, CC, BC, and EC. The
focus was on identifying the proteins with the highest number ofinteracting partners, which were deemed most important. While
DC is the most basic measure of centrality, it may not necessarily
reﬂect the protein ’s ability to carry out a speci ﬁc function, such as
attachment and invasion in the case of A. oryzae . CC, on the other
hand, takes into account the protein ’s ability to communicate
sequentially with other proteins in the network, which could be
more relevant to carrying out speci ﬁc functions. Hub proteins have
a high degree of connectivity, meaning they interact with many
other proteins. These hubs often play crucial roles in various cellular
functions and can be essential for processes like virulence in
pathogens. Their central position in the network makes themKhattak et al. 10.3389/fcimb.2023.1225285
Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology frontiersin.org 05potential targets for therapeutic intervention. BC can better re ﬂect
this fact than DC or CC since it measures the protein ’s importance
as a bridge between important hubs in the network. However, a
protein ’s ultimate importance lies in its connections to other
important proteins in the network, which can be measured by
EC. The top 10 important proteins were selected in each category on
the basis of network analysis and values of BC, DC, CC, and EC. All
the proteins were ranked in descending order based on their
parameter values and consolidated in a table ( Supplementary
Tables 3A ,B;Figure 1 ). The top 10 proteins selected in each
category of BC, DC, CC, and EC were further analyzed with the
help of Venny 2.1 ( https://bioinfogp.cnb.csic.es/tools/venny/ )t o
check for common proteins in the top 10 among BC, DC, CC,
and EC.
3.4 Virtual screening and docking analysis
The screening analysis of all the 100 selected compounds with
the aforementioned proteins, viz., guaA and metG, which were
already selected from the top ranker ’s proteins on the basis of
commonness in all centrality, was performed with help of Auto
Dock Vina. All the selected drugs are listed in Supplementary
Table 1 . Before docking, a structured model was created for both
proteins guaA and metG through https://swissmodel.expasy.org/ .
Both the structures were validated through a Ramachandran plot.
For guaA, almost 96.19% of residues were in the favored region
while only 0.28% was in the Ramachandran outlier region. Forstructure metG, almost 95.50% of residues were in the
Ramachandran favored regio n while only 0.54% was in the
Ramachandran outlier region ( Bordoli et al., 2009 ). The
structured model of both proteins guaA and metG and their
Ramachandran plot are presented in Figure 2 . The results ofTABLE 1 Data of selected proteins in the form of protein name, accession number, locus, locus tag, and protein length.

distance from best mode RMSD. The top ﬁve compounds having
the lowest bonding energy in kcal/mol, high bonding af ﬁnity, and
lowest RMSD were selected for docking studies. The data of ligand
screening against the selec ted proteins are arranged in
Supplementary Tables 2A ,B. The docking of the top selected
ligand among the 100 initial screened ligands was performed
against the aforementioned proteins, viz., guaA and metG. The
analysis of the docking results was based on the ranking of clusters
of compound conformations with various ligands ’binding energy
values. High af ﬁnity, indicating a strong binding between the ligand
and protein, is associated with a high release of free energy during
the binding process ( Pantsar and Poso, 2018 ). Molecular docking is
an important technique in structural molecular biology. The degree
to which a single biomolecule binds to its ligand or another binding
partner is referred to as its binding af ﬁnity ( Seo et al., 2021 ). Among
the top ﬁve compounds, Enfumafugin was selected for wet lab
studies on the basis of the highest number of hydrogen bonds, lowerbinding energy, and lowest inhibition constant values against both
guaA and metG. Based on the binding pattern of the
aforementioned proteins, Enfumafugin upon binding with guaA
showed a binding energy of −10.74, a reference RMSD value of 13.8,
and an inhibition constant (KI) of 13.41 nM as shown in Table 2 .
Enfumafugin exhibits signi ﬁcant interactions in its binding with the
protein. Notably, it engages in hydrogen –hydrogen (H –H)
interactions with SER 235 and VAL 238, as well as two separate
H–H interactions involving PHE 412. Additionally, there are two
hydrogen –carbon (H –C) interactions, one with GLY 237 and
another with SER 240. Furthermore, the compound forms three
alkyl bond interactions, with two occurring at VAL 316 and one at
PHE 319 of the guaA protein (as illustrated in Figures 3A ,B).
Regarding the binding characteristics, Enfumafugin demonstrates a
binding energy of −7.81, accompanied by a reference RMSD value
of 40.70 and an inhibition constant of 1.89 nM (as detailed in
Table 3 ). Its interactions with amino acid residues within the
protein are notably promising. Enfumafugin engages in H –H

molecular docking analysis is suggested by a lower energy
observed within the protein –ligand complex. This observation is
consistent with the ﬁndings reported by Smith et al. (2015) and
Schneider et al. (2011) .
3.5In vitro antibacterial activity
of Enfumafungin
The agar well diffusion method is widely used to evaluate the
antimicrobial activity of plants or microbial extracts ( Magaldi et al.,
2004 ;Valgas et al., 2007 ). Enfumafungin showed good antibacterial
activity against A. oryzae strain RS-1 at three different
concentrations after 24 h of incubation in the LB agar media.
Increasing the concentration of Enfumafungin increased inhibition
zone diameter. The highest zone was recorded to be 1.42 at 100 µg/
mL ( Figure 4 ). The second largest inhibition zone was achieved by aconcentration of 50 µg/mL, followed by 25 µg/mL ( Figure 4 ).
Enfumafungin was originally thought to be an antifungal
compound and proved to be very active against the Candida and
Aspergillus species. It was also proved that Enfumafungin does not
inhibit the growth of Bacillus subtilis (Onishi et al., 2000 ;Pela ́ez
et al., 2000 ). Overall results suggested that Enfumafungin showed a
good selective antimicrobial activity against strain RS-1.
3.6 Minimum inhibitory concentration of
Enfumafungin against A. oryzae
Theﬁndings of this study showed that after 12 h of incubation,
Enfumafungin has a discernible antibacterial activity against A.
oryzae strain RS-1 in comparison to the control. Varying amounts
of Enfumafungin had different antibacterial effects. Enfumafungin
generally reduced the OD 600values by 23%, 36%, 54%, and 91% at
doses of 25, 50, 100, and 200 µg/mL, respectively, while strain RS-1
showed the highest OD 600value (0.82) in the absence of

difference in the antibacterial activity of Enfumafungin between
the concentrations of 200 and 400 µg/mL, suggesting that Ao strain
RS-1 is extremely susceptible to both Enfumafungin doses. The
experimental MIC data strongly support the activity ofEnfumafungin against A. oryzae. The hydrogen bonding is
strongly correlated with the experimental values of MIC
(Ramachandran et al., 2020 ).
3.7 Effect of Enfumafungin on bio ﬁlm
formation of A. oryzae
We introduced a concentration of 50 and 100 µg/mL of
Enfumafungin to strain RS-1 in a microtiter plate, and after 1 day
of incubation at 30°C without stirring, the bio ﬁlm formation was
substantially affected in comparison to control ( Figure 5B ). In fact,
the A. oryzae strain RS-1 OD 570value was 0.1195 withoutEnfumafungin, compared to a lower OD 570value of 0.0625 and
0.0215 for strain RS-1 treated with 50 and 100 µg/mL
Enfumafungin, respectively. Moreover, it was also found that
Enfumafungin reduced bio ﬁlm of A. oryzae RS-1 in a dose-
dependent manner as we treated A. oryzae RS-1 with 50 and 100
µg/mL. In general, the OD 570value of the A. oryzae strains RS-1 was
reduced by 48% and 82%, respectively, as a result of the
Enfumafungin compared to the control.
3.8 Enfumafungin affects swarming and
motility of A. oryzae
We carried out the A. oryzae strain RS-1 swarming motility
assay to examine how AgNPs affect bacterial motility. The diameter
of the bacterial colony was found to be 0.90, 1.14, and 1.30 cm after
24 h, 48 h, and 72 h, respectively, of incubation in the presence of 50
µg/mL Enfumafungin, as shown in Figures 6A ,B, whereas the

Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology frontiersin.org 09diameter of the bacterial colony was found to be 1.68, 1.81, and 1.9
after 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h of incubation, respectively. It is clear that
Enfumafungin signi ﬁcantly inhibited the swarming motility of the
A. oryzae strain RS-1 regardless of the incubation time. The
swarming movement of A. oryzae strain RS-1 has been shown to
be commonly related with bacterial growth, propagation, and
pathogenicity ( Masum et al., 2019 ); therefore, Enfumafungin
inhibitory action is partially attributed to their ability to suppress
this motility.3.9 Bactericidal effect of Enfumafungin
proved by live/dead cell staining
Live/dead staining was utilized to see injured and healthy
membranes in bacterial cells subjected to 200 µg/mL
Enfumafungin in order to assess the viability of the bacteria.
When a combination of red and green dyes was used to stain
bacterial cells, only bacteria with intact cell membranes ﬂuoresced
green ( Figure 7 ), whereas bacteria with injured cell membranes

Enfumafungin, bacterial cells displayed mostly red ﬂuorescence.
The results clearly shows that Enfumafungin has a bactericidal
impact on the A. oryzae strain RS-1.
3.10 Enfumafungin damaged
bacterial cell surface
To assess the surface structure of the pretreated cells with
Enfumafungin, TEM of the A. oryzae strain RS-1 was performed.
Figure 8A shows bacterial cell morphology prior to treatment,
which are mostly round-shaped bacterial forms. Figure 8B shows
the extreme abnormalities of the cells following treatment with
Enfumafungin. Figure 8B shows that when the cells were treated
with Enfumafungin, the cell wall and membrane became curved and
damaged, but the untreated bacterial cell wall and membraneremained undamaged. TEM images revealed both severe and
extensive cell wall destruction, which led to protein and nucleic
acid leaks and ultimately led to bacterial mortality ( Ali et al., 2020 ).
Enfumafungin is an expensive antifungal agent, but large-scale
production of Enfumafungin on a commercial basis will decrease its
price and will become affordable. As production volumes increase,
the per-unit cost tends to decrease due to economies of scale
(Stigler, 1958 ) .A p a r tf r o mt h a ta u t o m a t i o n ,r e d u c i n gw a s t e ,
i m p r o v i n ge n e r g ye f ﬁciency, and enhancing the overall
production work ﬂow will also decrease the price ( Christiaanse
and Hulstijn, 2012 ). So far, there is no study or report of toxicity
of Enfumafungin against humans or animals; in the future, if it
happens, there are several measures we can take to reduce the
amount of toxicity caused by Enfumafungin. We can use
Enfumafungin as a seed priming agent instead of spraying it
directly on a rice ﬁeld. With multiple ﬁeld trials, we can assess
the amount of Enfumafungin accumulated in rice grains, and then

Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology frontiersin.org 11we can easily assess the amount of toxicity caused by Enfumafungin;
hence, we can optimize dose to avoid toxicity. As every chemical is
degradable and has a speci ﬁc half-life at a speci ﬁc temperature and
in a speci ﬁc environment, with multiple ﬁeld trials, we can assess
the half-life of Enfumafungin in different conditions and can easily
avoid Enfumafungin toxicity.
4 Conclusion
Multidrug resistance has increased dramatically in the last two
decades. Therefore, drug repurposing is gaining importance. The
analysis and prediction of the activity of existing and novel drug
ligands for new protein targets are based on the concept that similar
compounds tend to have similar biological properties. Similarly,
incorporating a structure-based approach focuses on obtaining
proteins likely to have similar functions and/or to recognize
similar ligands. Thus, in the ﬁeld of drug repurposing, protein
comparison is used as a method to identify secondary targets of an
approved drug. To hypothesize a new target for treating BBS diseaseinO. sativa , we have explored the results of a network-based
approach to identify the most indispensable proteins important
for next-generation drugs ( Pela ́ez et al., 2000 ). The present study
further develops this work at a structural level. From our study,
proteins guaA and metG have been demonstrated to be potential
druggable targets for the new ligand Enfumafugin. Thus,
Enfumafugin confers high binding af ﬁnity toward the target
proteins guaA and metG with a binding af ﬁnity comparable to
the approved drugs. Enfumafugin is a strong antifungal compound
while our study suggests that Enfumafugin is a selective
antibacterial compound that inhibits A. oryzae growth at a
concentration of 100 µg/mL, which a major breakthrough in the
ﬁeld of drug discovery.
