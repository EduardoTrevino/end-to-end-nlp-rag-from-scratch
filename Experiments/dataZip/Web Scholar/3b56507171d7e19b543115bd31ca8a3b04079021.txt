T h ep r e d i c t i v ep e r f o r m a n ce of polygenic scores (PG S) is largely dependent on
the number of samples available to tra in the PGS. Increasing the sample size
for a speci ﬁc phenotype is expensive and takes time, but this sample size can
be effectively increased by using gene tically correlated phenotypes. We pro-
pose a framework to generate multi-PGS from thousands of publicly availablegenome-wide association studies (GWAS) with no need to individually selectthe most relevant ones. In this study, the multi-PGS framework increases
prediction accuracy over single PGS for al l included psychiatric disorders and
other available outcomes, with prediction R

attention-de ﬁcit/hyperactivity disorder c ompared to a single PGS. We also
generate multi-PGS for phenotypes without an existing GWAS and for case-
case predictions. We benchmark the m ulti-PGS framework against other
methods and highlight its potential a pplication to new emerging biobanks.
Although polygenic scores (PGS) have high potential for clinical use1–3,
they are currently underpowered for many applications regardingdisease prediction and risk strati ﬁcation. The predictive performance
of PGS is largely determined by four factors: the sample size of the
GWAS used for training the score, the proportion of causal variantsand the heritability of the phenotype , as well as heterogeneity between
GWAS and target samples, including differences in genetic ancestry
4–6.
Increasing the number of samples for a phenotype is costly and takestime, but a possible alternative is to use genetically correlated phe-
notypes to increase the effective sample size at no cost

summary statistics ﬁle corresponding to different p-value thresholds
or proportions of causal variants15(i.e. the PGS model hyper-para-
meters). For the latter, the number of included PGS can become verylarge (e.g. 10 for each GWAS summary statistic number), whichincreases the number of validation samples required to ﬁt the model
and limits the number of PGS that can be included in practice.
Recent advances in PGS methods allow us to generate scores for a
phenotype without requiring validation data to tune the hyper-parameters
16–20. This development has two major implications in the
context of prediction using multiple PGS. First, individual-level geno-type validation data for each of the correlated phenotypes included inthe prediction model is no longer necessary because selecting the
best-performing hyper-parameters is no longer needed. Second, PGS
for any genetically correlated phenotype, even those not available inthe target data, can now be included easily in the same predictionmodel, which signi ﬁcantly expands the set of phenotypes one can
study. Therefore, as only one PGS per phenotype needs to be includedin the prediction model, the only practical limitation is effectively thenumber of individual-level samples available for the desired pheno-type, which is constantly growing for biobank data.
In this work, we propose and evaluate a multi-PGS framework that
leverages these key PGS developments to construct more powerfuland generalisable prediction models. These multi-PGS models can be
trained on thousands of different PGS such as for health outcomes,
body measurements, and behavioral phenotypes which are notnecessarily genetically correlated with the outcome. Multiple PGS andcovariates can be combined using either a linear model (lasso pena-lized regression) or a nonlinear model (XGBoost
21) into a multi-PGS
model. This model is then evaluated in an independent dataset interms of the prediction accuracy of the multi-PGS. We apply our multi-PGS framework to the Lundbeck Foundation Initiative for IntegrativePsychiatric Research (iPSYCH)
22,23, one of the largest datasets on the
genetics of major psychiatric disorders. These disorders are geneti-cally correlated with many other psychiatric and neurological dis-orders as well as other behavioral phenotypes
24,25, which are precisely
the circumstances under which the proposed multi-PGS might boost
the polygenic prediction accuracy. We benchmark the multi-PGSagainst each phenotype ’s respective single PGS prediction and com-
pare it with an existing PGS method that meta-analyzes multiple PGSsusing GWAS summary statistics, wMT-SBLUP

our multi-PGS framework and its potential advantage to be applied tonew emerging biobank data.

Overview of method
Here we summarize the framework used for generating the proposedmulti-PGS. This framework consists of three steps (Fig. 1). In Step 1
“Build PGS Library ”, a large, agnostic library of PGS is generated by
running LDpred2-auto
16on publicly available GWAS summary sta-
tistics (GWAS Catalog26, GWAS ATLAS27, PGC28etc.). In Step 2 “Train
Multi-PGS Models ”, the PGS library is standardized (i.e., mean 0 and
variance 1) and used to develop multi-PGS prediction models for atarget outcome using both a linear model (lasso penalized regres-sion) and a non-linear model (boosted gradient trees, XGBoost).These models include sex, age and 20 ﬁrst PCs as covariates for
training. Finally in Step 3 “Evaluate models ”, the multi-PGS models
are projected into the test data, evaluated in terms of predictionaccuracy and benchmarked against single PGS and another

dation to alternate between Step 2 and Step 3 to get out-of-sampleprediction accuracy estimates.
Using the proposed multi-PGS framework, we generated a library
of 937 PGS models (described in detail in Supplementary Methods)and projected it into the genotypes of individuals in iPSYCH. We thentrained multi-PGS models for 6 major psychiatric disorders: attention-deﬁcit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), affective disorder (AFF), anor-
exia nervosa (AN), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), bipolar disorder(BD) and schizophrenia (SCZ). We focus the ﬁrst part of the results
section on these 6 psychiatric disorders and extend the multi-PGS
application to other 62 ICD10 code disease de ﬁnitions, continuous
phenotypes and case-case classi ﬁc a t i o ni nt h el a s tr e s u l ts e c t i o n .
Linear and non-linear combinations of PGS give comparable
prediction results
Weﬁrst studied risk prediction models that combine covariates (sex,
age and ﬁrst 20 PCs) and the 937 PGS using linear models (lasso
penalized regression; multiPGS_lasso) and non-linear models (boostedgradient trees: multiPGS_XGBoost) to predict 6 major psychiatric dis-orders: ADHD, AFF, AN, ASD, BD and SCZ. We used a model including asingle PGS for the largest available GWAS for each psychiatric disorder
as the standard reference (ST3). In terms of variance explained, the
multi-PGS increased the mean R
24-fold on average over the single
GWAS PGS for all disorders, with up to 9-fold improvement for ADHDand ASD (Fig. 2A), from 0.8 to 7.5 and from 0.2 to 2, respectively.
Compared to the middle risk score quintiles, the top multi-PGS quintilegenerally increased the log odds ratio over the single GWAS
PGS (Fig. 2B).
In terms of which multi-PGS performed better at combining the
variables, the results appear to be disorder speci ﬁc. For ADHD, ASD
and BD the lasso multi-PGS increased the mean prediction R2 over theXGBoost multi-PGS. On the contrary, for AFF and AN the XGBoostmulti-PGS increased the mean prediction R
2over lasso multi-PGS. For
SCZ, there was no difference in variance explained by the two PGS.
We further investigated if the increase in prediction of the
XGBoost multi-PGS over lasso multi-PGS was driven by the nonlinear
combination of covariates alone, and if it was independent from the
PGS combination. In practice, we obtained an XGBoost risk score forthe covariates and ﬁtted it as an additional variable in the lasso model,
together with the 937 PGS. The mean v ariance explained by this mixed
multi-PGS was comparable to the lasso multi-PGS for ADHD, ASD, BDand SCZ, while it was comparable to the mean variance explained bythe XGBoost multi-PGS for AFF and AN. This demonstrated that thenon-linear combination was only bene ﬁcial at the covariate level and
not at the PGS-level.
Less pronounced differences were observed in terms of the
mean area under the curve (AUC) prediction (SF5), indicating thatboth models are similar in terms of classi ﬁcation. In terms of
quintile odds ratio, the lasso multi-PGS was generally the best at
separating the top 20% to the middle quintile, even for the modelswhere the maximum mean variance was explained by the XGBoostmulti-PGS (Fig. 2B). Since the two multi-PGS provided relatively
similar results, we continued further analyses on the psychiatricADHD

sion, combining the 937 PGS and the predicted values of an XGBoost model that
included only the covariates. 95% con ﬁdence intervals were calculated from 10,000

linear models are more interpretable.
Comparison between single PGS and multi-PGS predictors
Next, we investigated which of the 937 PGS in the multi-PGS modelwere the ones contributing the most to increasing prediction accuracy.First, we identi ﬁed the number of non-zero PGS selected by the lassomodel, which ranged from 10 to 154 for the 6 psychiatric disorders
(Fig. 3, non-zero PGS number inside the multi-PGS_lasso bar plot). All
non-zero mean weighted PGS are available at SF7-SF12. While ADHD
and ASD had over 100 PGS included, BD had only 10. This couldexpress the larger amount of genetically-correlated phenotypes in thePGS library with ADHD and ASD compared to BD, but could also be areﬂection of the training sample size. The larger the training sample38 PGS135 PGS

Nature Communications |         (2023) 14:4702 4size, the larger the power to identify genetically correlated phenotypes
in the PGS library through lasso regression.However, weights weregenerally very small, with few PGS with an absolute lasso weight largerthan 0.01 (Fig. 3, number of PGS with absolute weight larger than 0.01
inside the multi-PGS_lasso_s and wMT-SBLUP bar plots). Among thetop 5-weighted PGS for each psychiatric disorder, we always identi ﬁed
the PGS from the PGC GWAS excluding iPSYCH samples for alldisorders.
For affective disorder, three depression PGS were selected, two
from the PGC
29,30(tagged MDD-PGC2 and MDD Howard) and one from
a UK Biobank GWAS on depressive symptoms31(tagged Depressive
symptoms). These results con ﬁrm that non-overlapping signals from
multiple GWAS of similar phenotypes can be combined to increaseprediction accuracy. Interestingly, the PGS from the PGC GWASexcluding iPSYCH samples ranked 5th for ADHD. This study had only4225 cases, similarly to the ASD study, with 5305 cases. The iPSYCHindividuals were excluded from the PGC ADHD and ASD studies.
We compared the prediction accuracy of a multi-PGS with all
non-zero weights to a simpli ﬁed lasso multi-PGS that included only
PGS with an absolute lasso weight larger than 0.01, multi-PGS_lasso_s(Fig. 3, number of included PGS in the ﬁgure), showing very similar
mean R
2. Prediction estimates for the top 5 PGSs in each model
ranked by their lasso weights are also shown in Fig. 3, with the top
PGS generally contributing to half of the prediction accuracy of the
multi-PGS.
By using the lasso regression as a feature selection algorithm (only
selecting the ones with large weights), it was feasible to compare theprediction accuracy to another prediction method using multiplePGSs, wMT-SBLUP
8, as this method estimates weights for all PGS in the
prediction. The PGS weights in wMT-SBLUP are calculated as a functionof the GWAS summary statistics ’sample size, SNP-heritability and
genetic correlation (SF12 contains an overview of these parameters forthe top 10 PGSs in each model). The simpli ﬁed multi-PGS showed
consistently higher mean R
2than wMT-SBLUP, even though they both
contained the same number of PGS.
Combining hundreds of external PGS increases prediction over
training only on the individual-level data
One of the potential issues of comparing single-PGS to multi-PGS
methods is the use of individual-level data for training in multi-PGS,
given that for some analyzed disorders the number of cases is larger iniPSYCH than in the rest of the PGC cohorts (ST3). Here, we comparedthe prediction accuracy of single-PGS (based on GWAS summary sta-tistics) and multi-PGS (based on both GWAS summary statistics andindividual-level data) to a best linear unbiased predictor (BLUP) PGS(based on individual-level data). We used ﬁvefold cross validation for
deriving both the multi-PGS and BLUP PGS, so that the reportedadjusted R
2are out-of-sample estimates. The resulting comparison
showed that the prediction accuracy of multi-PGS outperformed bothsingle-PGS and BLUP PGS predictions, indicating that the accuracygained from multi-PGS was not only based on sample size but on the
u s eo fal a r g ea n dd i v e r s es e to f9 3 7P G S( F i g . 4A). As shown
previously
32, the BLUP PGS vs. single GWAS PGS varied in the relative
proportion of variance explained according to the psychiatric dis-order, as they are largely dependent on the training sample sizes andgenetic correlation. We observed these large differences also in termsADHD

o ft h es a m p l e( F i g . 4B).
Next, we further explored the capacity of our multi-PGS to predict
outcomes for which there are no available external GWAS summary
statistics. This question is inspired by a scenario where the studied
outcome could bene ﬁt from PGS analyses, but there is still no GWAS
for that outcome. We tested this by simulating a scenario where the sixanalyzed psychiatric disorders did not have external PGC GWAS. Inpractice this meant removing each time the disorder ’sP G Sf r o mt h e
PGS library, resulting in a PGS library of 936 scores. For affective dis-order (AFF), we removed the two depression PGS from the library. Thedifference in mean prediction R2 was not signi ﬁcantly different
between both multi-PGS (using either 937 or 936 PGS) for any psy-chiatric disorders (Fig. 4A). Moreover, the multi-PGS that did not
contain the disorder ’s external PGS was not signi ﬁcantly worse at
separating the risk quintiles in terms of log OR (Fig. 4B). These results
indicate that it is possible to generate multi-PGS for a speci ﬁco u t c o m e
without the need of a GWAS for that same phenotype, given that thePGS library contains scores for genetically correlated outcomes.
Generating multi-PGS from register-based phenotypes
Finally, we extended the multi-P GS results to other phenotypes
deﬁned in the Danish National Registers in the overlapping samples
with iPSYCH to showcase its potential to generate polygenic scores in abiobank framework. First, we selected 62 ICD10 codes from the DanishPsychiatric Central Research Register
33with at least 500 diagnosed
cases and compared the prediction performance of the multi-PGS
lasso to the multi-PGS XGBoost. Similarly to the results for the main 6psychiatric disorders, the mean prediction R2 for both multi-PGS wason average the same, but ultimately depended on the disorder (SF13).We emphasize that both these phenotypes all nested within the psy-chiatric disorder cases and population cohort of iPSYCH case-cohortdesign (ST4).
To expand the comparison to external data, we selected 15 phe-
notypes from four different categories; (a) other ICD10 codes withavailable GWAS summary statistics, (b) other ICD10 codes with notknown available GWAS summary statistics / disorder sub-phenotypes,
(c) continuous phenotypes from the Medical Birth Register
34and (d)
case−case predictions. For the last category, we explored two example
pairs of disorders with a high degree of comorbidity. First, we excludedthe cases with both disorders and re-codi ﬁed each single disorder case
as 0 or 1.
In this case we compared the prediction accuracy of the multi-PGS
against a single-PGS, the top weighted PGS as outputted from themulti-PGS lasso (ST5).
The results varied greatly for each phenotype, but there were
large increases in prediction accuracy of the multi-PGS for most phe-notypes (Fig. 5). The multi-PGS for the disorder pair ASD/ADHD
showed the largest prediction R2 of all examined multi-PGS, explaining
12% of the variation. On the other side of the spectrum, the multi-PGSfor outcomes such as APGAR score, gestational age or BD/MDDshowed null R2. Note that the PGS labeled MDD Howard
30is selected as
the top lasso weighted PGS for multiple outcomes (Fig. 5). This can be a
reﬂection of the sampling strategy in iPSYCH, where individuals diag-
nosed with ADHD, AN, AFF, ASD, SCZ and BD were over-sampledcompared to the population. The secondary phenotypes ’cases shown
in Fig. 5have a large overlap with affective disorder diagnoses (ST4).
Discussion
Here we have proposed a multi-PGS framework derived from nearly
one thousand GWAS summary statistics for different phenotypes, and
showed that it increased the accuracy of PGS for psychiatric disorders.Multi-PGS explained a larger proportion of the SNP-heritability (afourfold increase on average for the main psychiatric disorders over aPGS trained on the target outcome only) and strati ﬁed the populationin more distinct risk groups than single-phenotype PGS. The disorder
with the largest increase in prediction accuracy from multi-PGS wasADHD, with a ninefold increased prediction R2over the single PGS(corresponding to ~40% of the SNP h
2f35). This is mostly due to the
inclusion of various behavioral PGS in our library (educational attain-
ment, smoking status, etc.) with very large sample sizes and largegenetic correlation with ADHD.
While the compared linear multi-PGS (lasso) and non-linear multi-
PGS (XGBoost) resulted in similar prediction accuracies, the improvedperformance of the non-linear models for affective disorder andanorexia nervosa was due to the presence of non-linear covariateinteractions between sex and age, as previously reported
36.W e
therefore focused the analyses on the lasso multi-PGS, as those resultshave easier interpretability.
We benchmarked our multi-PGS prediction results against a PGS
trained on external GWAS summary statistics for each of the six major
psychiatric disorders respectively. The multi-PGS always resulted in amore accurate prediction, even when the phenotype itself was notincluded in the PGS library. When benchmarked against wMT-SBLUP
8,
another PGS method trained on GWAS summary statistics for multiplephenotypes, the multi-PGS also resulted in a more accurate prediction.The improvement in prediction accuracy is likely due to the fact thatwhile wMT-SBLUP bases its weights on the genetic correlation to theexternal GWAS summary statistics for each phenotype, multi-PGS istrained directly on the individual-level samples, allowing multi-PGS tobetter tailor the weights to the cohort. Interestingly, the multi-PGS still
obtained much more accurate predictions by combining hundreds of
external PGS. This result suggests that as both the number of genome-wide association studies and their sample size grows, training multi-PGS will become more feasible.
Finally, we showcased how multi-PGS can be used to train pre-
dictors for any phenotype of interest, as long as one has sufﬁcient
individual-level genetic data avail able with the phenotype of interest.
The multiPGS predictors do not requ ire PGS for the target phenotype
of interest to be available in the PGS library used. This application isparticularly interesting for sub-phenotype analyses within diseases,where GWAS summary statistics are not generally available for the sub-
phenotypes. We demonstrated in practice how these multi-PGS could
be generated for various psychiatric sub-diagnoses e.g. differentICD10 subcodes within Autism Spectrum Disorder (ICD10 F8). Similarmulti-PGS method could also be applied to other sub-phenotypes ofpsychiatric disorders like psychosis within bipolar disorder, as de ﬁned
in Hasseris et al.
37. Another exciting application we explored is the
case-case prediction, where multi-PGS models can be trained for highlycomorbid disorders. In this last category, we highlight the relativelyhigh prediction accuracy of our predictor of ADHD cases from a poolof ADHD-ASD cases.
This study and the multi-PGS approach has several limitations.
First, as we performed a ﬁvefold cross-validation in the iPSYCH (indi-
vidual-level) data when training and testing the multi-PGS, it is possiblethat some of the prediction accuracy gain is due to over ﬁtting. How-
ever, the multi-PGS also resulted in multiple null predictions despitehaving large training sample sizes (APGAR score and gestational age)suggesting that over ﬁtting is small. To further avoid over ﬁtting we
restricted the analyses to a set of unrelated individuals of Europeanancestry to control for population structure. Second, controlling forsample overlap between external and internal data, which can lead tooverﬁtting
38, becomes both dif ﬁcult and important when considering
thousands of GWAS summary statistics. We addressed this manually bychecking the GWAS summary statistics, but an automatization of this
step (e.g. using bivariate LDSC
39) could help streamline this procedure.
Third, the resulting multi-PGS is potentially predicting a subset ofi n d i v i d u a l si nt h ec a s eg r o u pe n r i c h e do rc o m o r b i dw i t hap h e n o t y p ewith large genetic correlation to the PGS phenotypes, but not thedisorder itself. Therefore, although multi-PGS can improve predictionArticle https://doi.org/10.103 8/s41467-023-40330-w
Nature Communications |         (2023) 14:4702 6accuracy, it should not be used to estimate genetic correlations or
study genetic overlap. Fourth, we have not explored whether includinga PRS trained on individual-level data could improve the predictionfurther, as suggested by a previous study
32. Fifth, we have not explored
how generalisable the multi-PGS are across different ancestry groups,but we expect the R
2prediction accuracy to decay with genetic dis-
tance between training and testing, as previously shown for PGS6,40.
However, as more individuals of non-European ancestry are included
in GWAS, the multi-PGS based on the resulting summary statistics may
be able to improve cross-ancestry prediction.
The same multi-PGS framework could be applied to other types of
biological data summary statistics, like GWAS for brain or cardiacimages
41,42, gene expression43, and/or protein levels44. Combiningdifferent types of data into a multi-PGS could potentially improve or
quantify the importance for predicti on of the different data types. The
framework can also make use of published PGS variant weights (e.g.from the PGS catalog
45) instead of deriving the PGS from the GWAS
summary statistics.
In this study, by leveraging nearly a thousand external PGS, we
show how we can increase the polygenic prediction further withoutthe need to genotype more individuals of a speci ﬁcp h e n o t y p e .W e
think this multi-PGS framework has a lot of potential for new
emerging biobanks or register-based genetic cohorts to generatePGS for every available phecode or de ﬁned phenotype in their
system, both because of the ever growing set of publicly availableGWAS summary statistics and, as they are new, these biobanks do45

PGS library construction
A detailed description of the PGS library construction and ﬁleﬁltering
process is provided as Supplementary Methods and all code used will
be available. A number of resources were used to obtain an initial list of
GWAS summary statistics for generating the PGS library. The majorityof the GWAS summary statistics were downloaded from publiclyavailable databases (GWAS Catalog
26,G W A SA t l a s27, the Psychiatric
Genomics Consortium Website ( https://www.med.unc.edu/pgc ). For
the speci ﬁc PGC GWAS summary statistics where iPSYCH was used in
the discovery dataset, we used in-house GWAS results where thesesamples were excluded from the calculation. The GWAS ﬁles were
speci ﬁcally selected to be based on European ancestry individuals, to
not be overly redundant (only the latest GWAS for each same pheno-type) and to not contain iPSYCH samples. From an original list of 6206
ﬁles (ST1), this ﬁltering resulted in 1377 ﬁles to download.
We developed a pipeline for downloading, parsing, reformatting
and doing a quality control ﬁlter on the list of ﬁles. We created a GWAS
summary statistic column-name library (SF1) to ease ﬁle parsing, and
after re-formatting and removing corrupted ﬁles, this step resulted in
1005 ﬁles. We restricted the number of SNPs to the overlap of the
iPSYCH imputed variants with the HapMap3 variants and the LDreference provided by LDpred2, resulting in a maximum of 1,053,299SNPs per GWAS summary statistics ﬁle. Filtering SNPs with a large
discrepancy in standard deviation between the genotyped/imputeddata and the GWAS summary statistics can increase the robustness and
prediction accuracy of PGS
46.F o re a c h ﬁle, we created a QC plot for
visual inspection of the QC SNP ﬁltering (Example in SF2). The set of
952 GWAS summary statistics that passed QC and kept over 200,000SNPs were used to derive PGS with LDpred2-auto
16.
Polygenic score weights were derived using LDpred2-auto, a
method within the LDpred2 framework16that does not require a vali-
dation dataset to ﬁt the hyperparameters (SNP-h2; SNP-based herit-
ability estimate and p; proportion of causal SNPs), but these are ﬁtted
as part of the Gibbs sampler instead. We used the provided European-ancestry independent LD blocks as reference panel
46.F o re a c hG W A S
summary statistics ﬁle, LDpred2-auto was run with 30 Gibbs sampler
chains, 800 burn-in iterations and 400 iterations. The SNP-h2 initial
value was set to the LD score regression estimate47from the GWAS
summary statistics after. Each of the chains was initialized with a dif-ferent prior for the proportion of causal variants: [1e-4, 0.9] in log scale(example plot for a chain in SF3). Chains were ﬁltered according to the
recommendation in the LDpred2 tutorial, and effect sizes of chainskept were averaged. After running LDpred2-auto on the QC ’dﬁle set
and post-processing, we were left with 937 PGS. This constitutes theﬁnal PGS library and all information on its GWAS summary statistics
meta-data, number of SNPs per ﬁle on each step, number of chains on
theﬁnal PGS and estimates of SNP-h2 and p can be found in SD1. A plot
comparing the LDSC and LDpred2-auto SNP-h2 estimates can be
found at SF4.
iPSYCH data
Genotypes and imputation . The iPSYCH 2015 case-cohort sample is a
genotyped dataset from neonatal dried blood spots (DBS) nestedwithin the entire Danish population born between 1981 and 2008,
including 1,657,449 persons22,23.A f t e rg e n o t y p i n ga n ds a m p l eq u a l i t y
control, it includes 92,765 individuals diagnosed with a major psy-chiatric disorder i.e. attention-de ﬁcit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD),
affective disorder (AFF), autism (ASD), schizophrenia (SCZ) and bipo-
lar disorder (BD). We also included the anorexia nervosa (AN; ANGI-DK) samples from the Anorexia Nervosa Genetics Initiative (ANGI)
48,a s
they were samples within the same framework as iPSYCH 2015. Thedataset also includes 42,912 individuals randomly sampled from thesame birth cohort, making it representative of the general Danishpopulation. The genotype data was imputed using the HaplotypeReference Consortium (HRC)
49as the reference panel and following
the RICOPILI pipeline50. After removing SNPs with minor allele fre-
quency (MAF) < 0.01 and Hardy-Weinberg pvalue < 10-6, we restricted
to the HapMap3 variants in the LDpred2 LD reference panel, resulting
in 1,053,299 SNPs.
Principal components & relatedness . We performed principal com-
ponent analysis (PCA) following Privé et al.51and obtained 20 PCs. The
process has already been described in Albiñana et al.32. Using the set of
20 PCs, we de ﬁned genetically homogeneous individuals as having
<4.5 log distance units to the multi dimensional center of the 20 PCs
(calculated using the function dist_ogk from the R packagebigutilsr
51,52). We also computed the KING-relatedness robust coef ﬁ-
cient of the sample and excluded the second of each pair with >3rddegree relatedness. We identi ﬁed a set of 108,031 unrelated genetically
homogeneous individuals (Danish-European ancestry), which we used
for all subsequent analyses.
List of phenotypes and ICD10 codes . We used phenotypes from the
Danish Psychiatric Central Research Register
33with register data
available until December 2016. Except for the category of all psychia-tric disorders (ICD10, F-chapter), all categories of diagnosis are given avariable name starting with a letter and followed by four digits. Theﬁrst letter is the chapter of disease in the ICD10 system and the ﬁrst
number is the ICD10 diagnosis. The other 3 numbers are not infor-mative of ICD10 diagnosis. We also used 3 continuous phenotypes
from the Danish Medical Birth Register
34: apgar5 (Apgar score, 5 min
after birth), fvagt (birth weight in grams) and gest_age (gestational agein completed weeks). All used phenotypes, sample sizes and metadataare available at SD3-SD4.
Multi-PGS models
We used the library of 937 PGS to tr ain multi-phenotype predictors
(multi-PGS) using two different algorithms (1) L1 penalized regression(lasso) as implemented in the R package glmnet
53and (2) tree gradient
boosting as implemented in the XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting)algorithm in the R package xgboost
21. For both models, we trained a
base model using only the covariates (sex, birth year and 20 PCs) and a
full model using the covariates plus the 937 standarized LDpred2-autoPGS. For the base model, we used the glm function with the optionfamily = “logistic ”. For lasso, we used the function cv.glmnet from the
glmnet R package with the options alpha = 0 and family = “binomial ”
for binary phenotypes. The covariates were not regularized by givingthem a penalty factor of 0 with the option penalty.factor, while the restof the PGS were given a penalty factor of 1. For XGBoost, we used thexgboost function from the xgboost R package with options eta = 0.01and nrounds = 10. We used objective = “binary:logistic ”for binary
phenotypes and objective = “reg:squarederror ”for continuous
variables.
BLUP PGS
We computed an internal best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) PGStrained on the individual-level data. We obtained the per-SNP predic-tion betas with BOLT-LMM
54,55(using the ﬂag–predBetasFile) on theArticle https://doi.org/10.103 8/s41467-023-40330-w
Nature Communications |         (2023) 14:4702 8set of 1,118,443 HM3 SNPs on iPSYCH. Depending on the polygenicity
of the phenotype, BOLT-LMM computes a mixture-of-Gaussians prioror a single-Gaussian BOLT-LMM-inf model, equivalent to best linearunbiased prediction (BLUP). In the case of psychiatric disorders, our
results show that BOLT-LMM-inf is always the model selected and
therefore we refer to the BOLT-LMM PGS as BLUP PGS.
Evaluation of prediction accuracy
For each phenotype, we used a ﬁvefold cross-validation scheme to
obtain out-of-sample prediction accuracy estimates. The prediction wasevaluated by (1) adjusted variance explained in the liability scale. Weused population prevalences speci ﬁed in SD2 to convert the variance
explained in a linear regression to the liability scale
56.T h ea d j u s t e d R2
was de ﬁned as the variance explained by the full model after accounting
for the variance explained by the base model as R2_adjusted = (R2_full -
R2_cov)/(1 −R2_cov). (2) Odds ratio (OR) of the 5th quintile to the
middle quintile. All OR were calculated from a logistic regression modelbased on the PGS percentiles, sex, birth year and ﬁrst 20PCs.
