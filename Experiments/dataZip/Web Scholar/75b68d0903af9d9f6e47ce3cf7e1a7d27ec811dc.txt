Abstract
We study the problem of watermarking large language models (LLMs) generated text — one of
the most promising approaches for addressing the safety challenges of LLM usage. In this paper, we
propose a rigorous theoretical framework to quantify the effectiveness and robustness of LLM watermarks.
We propose a robust and high-quality watermark method, Unigram-Watermark , by extending an
existing approach with a simplified fixed grouping strategy. We prove that our watermark method enjoys
guaranteed generation quality, correctness in watermark detection, and is robust against text editing and
paraphrasing. ExperimentsonthreevaryingLLMsandtwodatasetsverifythatour Unigram-Watermark
achieves superior detection accuracy and comparable generation quality in perplexity, thus promoting the
responsible use of LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/XuandongZhao/Unigram-Watermark .

21 Introduction
Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) [Brown et al., 2020, Ramesh et al., 2022, Saharia et al., 2022, OpenAI,
2023a] has achieved significant progress in recent years, spanning from computer vision (CV) to natural
language processing (NLP). Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT [OpenAI, 2022] can generate
coherent and contextually relevant long-form text in response to user-specified prompts. However, the ease
of using LLMs has raised concerns about their potential misuse [Zellers et al., 2019, Weidinger et al., 2021,
Stokel-Walker, 2022]. For example, LLMs could be used to generate fake news, contaminate web content, or
assist in academic dishonesty. Additionally, the proliferation of synthetic data from LLMs poses challenges
for training new models, as synthetic data needs to be detected and excluded before model training [Radford
et al., 2022, Carlini et al., 2023].
There are two main camps of existing attempts to address these challenges. One camp, inspired by Turing
[1950], aims at generically distinguishing machine-generated text from that of the humans [Gehrmann et al.,
2019, Mitchell et al., 2023, Hovy, 2016, Zellers et al., 2019, OpenAI, 2023b]. These works primarily leverage
hand-crafted or learned “statistical patterns” of generated text, thus their performance is not robust to
distribution changes (e.g., by prompting / conditioning), prone to biases [Liang et al., 2023], and vulnerable
to adversarial attacks.
The other camp advocates active intervention by injecting carefully-designed watermarks to machine-generated
text [Kirchenbauer et al., 2023, Zhao et al., 2023]. The watermarking approach does not search for statistical
patterns (which could be hit-or-miss), but rather deliberately plantsubtle but distinctive patterns within the
content to enable downstream detection. Compared to the passive detection approaches, the watermarking
methods aim at determining whether the text is coming from a specificlanguage model rather than solving
the Turing test generically. As a result, watermarking approaches are robust to distribution-shift and can
essentially prove— rather than predict— the origin of the suspect text.
The most notable challenge for the watermarking approach is that the planted patterns could be post-processed
away. As an example, Kirchenbauer et al. [2023]’s soft watermarking method divides the vocabulary into a
“green list” and a “red list” based on the prefix token, and subtly increases the probability of choosing from
the green list. If the watermarked sentence is edited by changing every other token into its synonym, then it
is no longer possible to determine the green/red lists for each candidate token, thus ruining the detector.
One could also simply paraphrase the sentence as a whole using another off-the-shelf LLM.
In this paper, we take a first stab at formally defining robustness in the context of watermarking LLMs. Our
contributions are fourfold.
1.We devise a rigorous theoretical framework for quantifying the performance drop, the correctness of
detection, and the security property against post-processing.
2.We propose to simplify the scheme of Kirchenbauer et al. [2023] by using a fixed Green-Red split consistently
and show that the new watermark, named Unigram-Watermark , istwice as robust to edits as the
baseline, provably.
3.We prove that the watermarked LLM is close to the original LLM (in all Renyi divergences) and show
that the Type I/Type II errors of the detection algorithm decay exponentially as the suspect text length
gets longer and more diverse.
4.We conduct experiments utilizing various large language models on diverse datasets. The results indicate
that our method achieves superior detection accuracy and improved robustness against different attacks,
thus promoting the responsible use of LLMs.
To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to obtain provably robust guarantees for watermarks for LLMs
against arbitrary edits.
Related work. We build upon the work of Kirchenbauer et al. [2023] in which the family of K-gram
(statistical) watermark was proposed1. The main method we consider chooses K= 1, thus its name Unigram-
1Note the changed name. Kirchenbauer et al. [2023] referred to its (unnamed) soft-watermark that determines the green/red
list using a prefix of length (K−1). We think K-gram watermark is the most concise and informative name for this family.
3Watermark . Our work provides formal theoretical guarantees to this family of K-gram watermark. For
the sake of a clean presentation, we focus on the case when K= 1and discuss the applicability of our
results for K > 1in the discussion section. Our work is independent of the concurrent work of cryptographic
watermarks [Aaronson, 2023, Christ et al., 2023]. In particular, Aaronson [2023]’s proprietary work can also
be viewed as an alternative K-gram watermark, but uses a cryptographic approach for measuring utility
drop, which results in a different kind of tradeoff. We defer detailed discussion to an extended discussion
of the related work in Appendix A. Technically, the main theoretical tool we used for analyzing dependent
random variables and their concentration tightly is due to Albert [2019], the instantiation to our problem is
new and nontrivial.
2 Problem setup and method
We start with an overview of the language model watermarking problem. The definitions and notations
introduced in this section will be used throughout the paper.
Language models. A language model (LM) Mis a statistical model that describes the probability of
a sequence of words occurring in a sentence. Common neural language models (e.g., GPT-2/3 [Radford
et al., 2019, Brown et al., 2020]) are designed for next-word prediction which typically uses a transformer
neural network [Vaswani et al., 2017]. The LM has a “vocabulary” Vwith N:=|V|= 50,000tokens or more
[Radford et al., 2019, Liu et al., 2019]. Let xbe an input prompt. y:=[y1, . . . , y n]arentokens generated by
M. During inference, Mreceives the input prompt xas the prefix of generation. It iteratively computes
logit scores ℓtfor every next token. The logits transform into a probability distribution via soft-(arg)max
function pt[v] =exp(ℓt[v])Pi∈Vexp(ℓt[i])for all v∈ V. The LM then samples the next token from this distribution:
yt∼pt.
2.1 Definition of language model watermarking
In the language model watermarking problem, the objective for the model owner is to embed a secret
message known as “watermark” within the generated sequence yfor a given prompt x. There are two desired
requirements for watermarking. First, the quality of the watermarked model should be comparable to the
quality of the original, un-watermarked model. Second, an adversary needs to modify sufficiently many
AI-generated text in order to evade detection.
Definition 2.1 (Edit distance) .The edit distance, denoted as ED(y,z), quantifies the number of basic
operations required to transform a sequence yinto another sequence z. These operations include “insertion”,
“deletion”, and “replacement” of tokens.
Definition 2.2 (Language model watermarking) .Alanguage model watermarking scheme consists of
two probabilistic polynomial-time algorithms (Watermark ,Detect ):
•Watermark (M): Let Mbe a language model and let pt:=PM(x)[yt=·|y1:t−1]be theconditional
probability distribution of t-th token on Vgenerated by M. This algorithm produces a new model ˆM
with a new conditional distribution ˆpt:=PˆM(x)[yt=·|y1:t−1]onV. Additionally, it outputs a detection
keykassociated with ˆM. The watermark could contain certain randomness.
•Detect (k,y): This algorithm takes input detection key kand sequence y, then outputs 1 (indicating it was
generated by ˆM) or 0 (indicating it was notgenerated by ˆM).
We require the following three correctness properties to hold:
•ω-Quality of watermarked output, for ω∈R: Assume the original language model Mgenerates a probability
vector ptfor the token at position t. The watermarked model ˆMpredicts the token at position tusing the
modified probability vector ˆpt. It is required that the distance between the two probability distributions
satisfies: D(ˆpt∥pt)≤ωfor any fixed prompts and prefixes.
4•αy-Type I error (“No false positives”): for any fixed y(i.e., independent to k), it holds that
Ph
Detect (k,y) = 1 ; ( ˆM,k)∼Watermark (M)i
≤αy.
•β(x,M)-Type II error (“No false negatives”):
Ph
Detect (k,y) = 0 ;(ˆM,k)∼Watermark (M)
y∼ˆM(x)i
≤β(x,M).
We also require the following security property (parameterized by ϵ≥0andη(y,k, ϵ)):
•For any adversary Athat postprocesses ywith auxiliary information auxand any prompt x∈ V∗
P
Detect (k,yA) = 1orED(y,yA)≥η(k,y, ϵ)y,k,
Detect (k,y)=1;(ˆM,k)∼Watermark (M)
y∼ˆM(x)
yA∼A(y,aux)
≥1−ϵ.
Remark 2.3 (Discussion on Definition 2.2) .Informally, our definition allows us to formally quantify the
essential properties of a language model watermarking scheme including its generation quality relative to
the input LM, the accuracy of detection in terms of both false positives and false negatives, as well as the
robustness to attacks.
The security property, in particular, states the following: suppose a malicious adversary intends to evade
the detection algorithm, then the adversarial answer, to some input prompt x, should be far away (in edit
distance) from any AI-generated answer. In other words, the optimal strategy to evade the detection algorithm
would necessitate executing a minimum number of insert/delete/replacement operations, captured by the
function η(·)in Definition 2.2. This conceptually suggests that the adversary must exert considerable effort
to successfully elude detection.
Admittedly, there are other attacks where edit distance does not capture either the effort or the utility loss.
For example, if one prompts an unwatermarked LLM to paraphrase ythen the number of edits can be large
but the semantic meaning is retained. However, edit distance is a natural metric that smoothly interpolates
the gray zone between the world where yA=yin which it should clearly be caught and the other world
where yAisindependently created without using ˆMin which it would be a false positive if Detectreturns 1.
2.2 Threat models
Adversary’s objective. The primary objective of the adversary is to render the watermark detection
algorithm ineffective. Specifically, the adversary aims to produce a yAsuch that Detect (k,yA) = 0while at
the same time, yAis a minor modification of an AI-generated text y.
Adversary’s capabilities. We consider an adversary with black-box input-output access to the language
model. This adversary has the capacity to modify the sequence within a bounded edit distance . Given an input
prompt x, the watermarked language model generates a text output y←ˆM(x). The adversary, equipped
with arbitrary side-information and computational resources, can then produce a modified output yAsuch that
the edit distance between the original and modified output, ED(y,yA), is bounded, i.e. ED(y,yA)< η.
2.3 Method
Now let us instantiate Definition 2.2 with concrete algorithms. We will focus on Unigram-Watermark
— a variant of the K-gram watermark proposed by Kirchenbauer et al. [2023] but with a choice of K= 1.
Pseudocodes of our approach Watermark andDetectare provided in Algorithm 1 and 2. In Algorithm 1, we
randomly partition the vocabulary into two distinct sets: the green list with γNtokens and the red list with
the remaining tokens. In ˆM, the logits of the language model for the green list tokens are increased by δ
while the logits for tokens in the red list remain unchanged. Then at detection time (Algorithm 2), we count
the number of green tokens in the suspect text, normalize the test-statistic, then make a calibrated decision

on whether we think the suspect text is generated from ˆMor not. We show the examples of real prompts
and watermarked outputs in Table 1.
The watermarking procedure is parameterized by two watermark strength parameters γ, δ.γdetermines the
fraction of the vocabulary included in the green list. We typically set γto be a constant, e.g., 1/3or0.5.δ
specifies the increase in the logits associated with the green list tokens. The larger δis, the lower the quality
of the watermarked LM, but the easier it is to detect.
OurUnigram-Watermark enjoys all good properties of the general K-gram watermark from Kirchenbauer
et al. [2023]. It runs in linear time and does not require access to the language model or the prompt used for
generation. It is also intuitively robust to cropping and minor edits.
Overall, the proposed watermarking scheme requires almost no overhead in its implementation, is extremely
simple, and is easy to maintain. The big question is:
How well does this watermark scheme work?
The remainder of this paper provides answers to this question with provable guarantees (Section 3) on the
properties from Definition 2.2 and extensive experiments (Section 4).
Before that, let us address two burning questions that a knowledgeable reader may have.
Why choosing K= 1?Recall that the general K-gram watermark works in the same way as ours, but
randomly generates a different Green list for each prefix of length K−1. In contrast, choosing K= 1means
we have a consistent green list for every new token the language model generates. The main advantage of
choosing K= 1is that it is the most robust choice within this family — and we believe robustness is the
single most important feature of a watermarking scheme in practice.
Robustness to other attacks. Besides the robustness to edits, which we will prove in Section 3 and
compare to that of K≥2.Unigram-Watermark is also resilient to many other kinds of generation time
attacks that people can apply such as reversing, shuffling, as well as the “Emoji insertion attack” that will

completely break the watermark for K≥2but not for K= 1. We provide a detailed discussion of this in
Appendix E.1.
The price for robustness? Kirchenbauer et al. [2023] did not consider the choice of K= 1for an obvious
reason. The watermark is now so simple that an attacker who observes the generated text may learn to
guess the consistent green list. This is an issue for K≥2too but certainly more so for K= 1. There
is a robustness-learnability tradeoff as we adjust Kwhich deserves a more rigorous treatment in future
work. That said, we are ready to argue for biasing towards robustness. Why? We argue that in practice,
it could be surprisingly difficult for an attacker to construct a meaningful attack when they do not have
access to the original LM. We provide a more detailed experimental study with a faithful practical attack in
Appendix B.4. Moreover, there are alternative ways to get around this issue by refreshing the green list once
in a while.
3 Main theoretical results
In this section, we present the quality, correctness, and security properties of Unigram-Watermark as
described in Definition 2.2.
3.1 Quality guarantee of Unigram-Watermark
We first show that the distance between the original probability vector ptand the watermarked probability
vector ˆptare very close to each other in any Renyi-divergence.
Theorem 3.1. Consider has the input to the language model at step t, denoted as h= [x,y1:t−1]. Fix
green list G. Let δrepresent the watermark strength. For any h, the α-th order Renyi-divergence between
the watermarked probability distribution ˆpt=ˆpt(·|h)at time step tand the original probability distribution
pt=pt(·|h)satisfies:
∀h,max 
Dα ˆpt∥pt
, Dα 
pt∥ˆpt
≤min{δ, αδ2/8}.
The proof, deferred to the appendix, leverages a surprising connection to modern techniques in the differential
privacy literature [Dwork et al., 2006, Dong et al., 2020].
Remark 3.2 (KL-divergence and other probability distance metrics) .Renyi-divergence is very general.
Kullback-Leibler-divergence and chi-square divergence are directly implied by the α-Renyi divergence bound
ofmin{δ, αδ2/8}by choosing α= 1andα= 2respectively and swap ˆpandp. Hellinger distance can
be obtained by choosing α= 0.5. By Pinsker’s inequality, we get a Total Variation distance bound
ofmin{p
δ/2, δ/4}. Moreover, by choosing α→ ∞, we obtain an upper bound of δfor a very strong
multiplicative guarantee known as max-divergence. The resulting two distributions ˆpandpare referred to
7by cryptographers as (δ,0)-indistinguishable , which says that for any measurable event S, the log-odds ratio
satisfies
−δ≤logˆpt(yt∈S|h)
pt(yt∈S|h)≤δ.
To summarize, our result shows that Algorithm 1 produces ˆMthat satisfies ω-quality of watermarked output
with ω(as a function of δ) for almost all commonly used probability distance D.
3.2 Type I error of Unigram-Watermark
Theorem 3.3 (No false positives (short version of Theorem C.4)) .Consider y=y1:nas anyfixedtext.
Define Cmax(y) :=max i∈[N]Pn

(over only the randomness of G):

nγ(1−γ).
The theorem says that the z-score for any sufficiently diverse text is ˜O(1)and it is applicable to any text not
generated by the watermarked LM ˆM.
Remark 3.4 (Controlling false positive rate) .The theorem implies that if we choose τ >q
64Vlog(9/α)
1−γ+
16Cmaxlog(9/α)√
nγ(1−γ), then the false-positive rate is smaller than α. Note that VandCmaxcan be computed directly
from y, allowing us to choose an input-dependent τas a function of V, C maxthat achieves a α-Type I error
guarantee with a fixed αfor all inputs. In particular, the Type I error αdecreases exponentially as we
increase the threshold τ.
3.3 Type II error of Unigram-Watermark
To bound the Type II error, i.e., false negative rates, we need to make certain assumptions about pof the
language model and the prompt x. These assumptions include a “on-average high entropy” assumption
and a“homophily” condition. We will provide a detailed definition and discussion of these assumptions in
Appendix C.4.1 and Appendix C.4.2.
The “on-average high entropy” assumption requires the probability of the roll-out text to be “sufficiently
diverse” on average. It is related but different from the “spike entropy” assumption used by Kirchenbauer
et al. [2023]. The “homophily” assumption is new to this paper. It is an assumption about the distribution
induced by the state-transitions of the language model M, which says that increasing the probability of a
green-list token at time tdoes not decrease the probability of seeing that token in the future. This may seem
counter-intuitive, but we will give concrete examples in Appendix C.4.2 to show why this is fundamental for
any statistical watermark to work effectively.
Theorem 3.5 (Only true positive (informal version of Theorem C.13)) .Assume “average-high entropy”
and “homophilly” to be valid with appropriate parameters, and in addition n≥˜Ω(log(1/β)/δ2), then with
probability 1−β,
zy≥Ω
(eδ−1)p
nγ(1−γ)
.
Remark 3.6.The bounds on Type I/II error together say that zy≍δ√nifyis from ˆMwhile zy≍O(1)
otherwise, i.e., there is a large margin between them so we can choose τin between. Also, the αandβ
parameters decay exponentially as the ngets larger.
83.4 Security property of Unigram-Watermark
We demonstrate the robustness of our watermarking scheme against editing attempts through Theorem 3.7.
As a baseline of comparison, we also obtain new robustness guarantees for the soft watermarking method
proposed in Kirchenbauer et al. [2023]. The detailed proof is deferred to the Appendix C.
Theorem 3.7 (Robustness to editing) .Lety=[y1, . . . , y n]represent the watermarked sequence. Suppose
the adversary Afollows Definition 2.2 and outputs a modified text u=[u1, . . . , u m]. Following Equation 2,
we calculate z-score zyandzu. Assume edit distance between yandu(denoted as η) satisfies η < n. Then
we have
zu≥zy−max(1 +γ/2)η√n,(1−γ/2)η√n−η
.
In particular, when η≤2γn
(1+γ/2)2, we can drop the second term in the max.
This theorem bounds the changes to our test z-score when ηedits are performed. As we established for a
high-entropy sequence, zytypically grows in O((eδ−1)√n), which means that when δis a constant, with an
appropriate choice of τ, the watermark is robust up to O(n)arbitrary edits!
Finally, compared to Kirchenbauer et al. [2023]’s watermark, ours is twice as robust (see Appendix D).
4 Experiment
In this section, we aim to conduct experiments to evaluate watermark detection performance, watermarked
text quality, and robustness against attacks compared to the baseline. Additional experiment results including
different parameters, white-box attacks, scaled language models, etc. are deferred to Appendix B.
4.1 Experiment setting
Datasets and prompts. We utilize two long-form text datasets: OpenGen and LFQA. OpenGen, collected
by Krishna et al. [2023], consists of 3K two-sentence chunks sampled from the validation split of WikiText-103
[Merity et al., 2017]. The subsequent 300 tokens serve as the human-written continuation. LFQA is a
long-form question-answering dataset created by Krishna et al. [2023] by scraping questions from Reddit,
posted between July and December 2021, across six domains. Krishna et al. [2023] randomly select 500
questions from each domain and pair them with their corresponding longest human-written answers, resulting
in 3K QA pairs. In our experiments, we use the questions as prompts and the corresponding answers as
human-written text.
Language models. We conduct experiments using three state-of-the-art public language models of varying
sizes from different model families: GPT2-XL with 1.5B parameters [Radford et al., 2019], OPT-1.3B [Zhang
et al., 2022], and LLaMA-7B [Touvron et al., 2023]. Nucleus Sampling [Holtzman et al., 2020] is employed
as the default decoding algorithm to introduce randomness while maintaining human-like text output. The
models are loaded from the Huggingface library [Wolf et al., 2019], and the generate API function is used to
adjust the logits distribution of the language model.
Evaluation methods. Maintaining a low false positive rate is crucial to prevent misclassifying un-
watermarked text as watermarked. To ensure this, we set the false positive rates at 1% and 10% for
all detection algorithms and adjust the detection threshold accordingly. We report true positive rate (TPR),
F1 score, and ROC curves. GPT3 ( text-davinci-003 ) [Ouyang et al., 2022], is used as the oracle model for
perplexity evaluation. The experiments are conducted on Nvidia A100 GPUs.
4.2 Watermarking results
We use a watermark strength of δ= 2.0and a green list ratio of γ= 0.5. We also use different watermark
keys kfor different models. Stronger watermarks can be achieved for shorter sequences for a smaller γand a
larger δ. From the two datasets, we generate 500 watermarked sentences and 500 un-watermarked sentences
using three different models (GPT2-XL, OPT-1.3B, and LLaMA-7B). We label them as “watermarked” and

to as "human". All sentences are cropped to a length of 200 tokens. z-scores are calculated for hypothesis
testing as shown in Algorithm 2 between different sentence groups. The results (Figure 1a) indicate a clear
distinction between watermarked and non-watermarked text. A default threshold of z-score = 6.0can be
used to determine if a text is watermarked. For a fair comparison with Kirchenbauer et al. [2023], we also set
δ= 2.0andγ= 0.5for their method.

human-generated text, especially with the use of the largest model
LLaMA-7B. This finding further supports the effectiveness of our
method in preserving linguistic characteristics and coherence, ensur-
ing seamless integration of watermarks without compromising overall
text quality. One example of the prompt questions and machine-
generated answers can be found in Table 1. We also conduct human
evaluations to assess text quality. We enlist crowd workers from
Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) to evaluate the quality of both
watermarked and unwatermarked texts. From the LLaMA-7B model on the OpenGen dataset, we select 100
watermarked and 100 unwatermarked texts, anonymize the sentences, and ask workers to rate the quality on
a scale of 1 (poor) to 5 (excellent). Each sentence undergoes two evaluations. The average score and standard
deviation are computed and presented in Table 3.
4.3 Robustness results
One of the key advantages of our method is its robustness. To provide comprehensive evidence of its resilience,
we conduct experiments to test its resilience against various attacking methods.
Paraphrasing attack. To demonstrate the superior robustness of our method, supported by our theorem,
we devise experiments to compare its performance against Kirchenbauer et al. [2023]. We employ different
paraphrase attack techniques targeting the removal of the watermark. Firstly, we utilized two versions of the
DIPPER model [Krishna et al., 2023], we denote them as “DIPPER-1” and “DIPPER-2”. DIPPER-2 has
greater diversity than DIPPER-1. Additionally, we leverage the ChatGPT API, generating paraphrased text

by providing prompts such as “ Rewrite the following paragraph: ”. Furthermore, we employ BART [Lewis
et al., 2019] ( bart-large-cnn , a large-sized model fine-tuned on the CNN Daily Mail dataset [Hermann
et al., 2015]) for text summarization as another type of paraphrasing attack. The results of our experiments
are shown in Figure 2 and Table 2. The results illustrate the substantial improvement in robustness achieved
by our method compared to Kirchenbauer et al. [2023]. Notably, our method achieves an accuracy rate of
over 85% with a false positive rate of 10%.
Editing attack. To further evaluate the robustness of Unigram-Watermark against edit attacks, we
examine its performance when subjected to synonym replacement, random deletion, and random swapping.
These edit attack scenarios represent common techniques used to manipulate text and potentially remove
watermarks. We conduct these attacks for the watermarked text of Unigram-Watermark and KGW+23.
The results are shown in Figure 2. In each scenario, our method consistently outperforms Kirchenbauer et al.
[2023] watermarking scheme, showcasing its enhanced resilience and effectiveness in protecting the integrity
of the embedded watermarks.

5 Conclusion and discussion
In this paper, we have addressed the concerns surrounding the potential misuse of large language models
and proposed an effective watermarking approach, Unigram-Watermark , for detecting machine-generated
text from a specificlanguage model. Our contributions include the development of a rigorous theoretical
framework, designing a provable effective, and robust watermarking scheme under this framework, as well as
conducting extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method in practice.
We anticipate that our work will inspire future research to develop more resilient watermarking methods
capable of withstanding a broader range of attacks.
Applicability to general K-Gram watermark. While we focused on Unigram-Watermark , most
of our results apply to K-Gram watermarks with K≥2too. These include the Type I error bound,
security properties (Robustness to edits), as well as the “Unique” alternative detector which we presented in
Appendix E. While our Type II error bound does not directlywork for K≥2, some of our intermediate steps
can be applied.
Limitations. While our watermarking method, Unigram-Watermark , demonstrates improved robustness
against edits, its reliance on a fixed Green-Red split may not be universally optimal. The performance and
robustness of watermarking methods can vary depending on the specific characteristics of the LLM and the
generated text. Additionally, although our method enhances detection capabilities, it is not immune to all
possible attacks.
Future work. Future work includes constructing unlearnable watermarks, understanding the robustness-
learnability tradeoff as well as unifying cryptographical and statistical watermarks.

Watermarking natural languages. The concept of watermarking, which involves hiding identifying
information within data, has a long history. However, watermarking digital text has been challenging due to
its discrete nature [Stefan et al., 2000]. Early approaches relied on techniques such as synonym substitution
[Topkara et al., 2006], syntactic structure restructuring [Atallah et al., 2001], or paraphrasing [Atallah et al.,
2002]. Later, advancements in modern neural language models led to improved methods that move away from
rule-based approaches. Different approaches have been proposed, such as encoding messages by context-aware
lexical substitution [Yang et al., 2022] or using mask-infilling models for editing text [Ueoka et al., 2021].
Recent studies [Zhao et al., 2023, Kirchenbauer et al., 2023] explore modifying the logits of language models
during token generation and embedding invisible watermarks in the decoding process. Our objective is to
develop a robust watermarking technique for natural language models that maintain high text quality while
effectively concealing identifying information.
Post-hoc detection. Rather than watermarking, an alternative approach involves developing detection
models for post-hoc analysis of machine-generated text. Some detection methods use statistical outlier
detection techniques without requiring additional training. For example, GLTR [Gehrmann et al., 2019]
assesses the expected probability of individual tokens and applies thresholding to identify AI-generated
content. DetectGPT [Mitchell et al., 2023] suggests that AI-generated passages tend to reside in the negative
curvature of the log probability of texts. Another set of methods relies on classifiers that are fine-tuned
to distinguish between human-written and machine-generated text. Initial efforts in this domain focus on
detecting fake reviews [Hovy, 2016] and fake news [Zellers et al., 2019]. More recently, OpenAI releases
a web interface that uses a finetuned GPT model for this discrimination task [OpenAI, 2023b]. However,
as language models improve, AI-generated text is becoming increasingly similar to human-generated text,
making it more challenging to detect. Gambini et al. [2022] find that existing detection strategies designed
for GPT-2 struggle with GPT-3. Moreover, known detectors are found to be fragile to adversarial attacks
[Wolff, 2020] and biased towards non-native English writers [Liang et al., 2023].
Impossibility results? Sadasivan et al. [2023] poses the question of whether detecting machine-generated
text is possible and argue that as the human distribution and LLM distribution of texts get closer, any
classifier will have to either have a large Type I error or a large Type II error. The authors also argue that (in
Corollary 2) if the watermarking scheme can be learned then paraphrasing attacks either evade the detector
or also classify humans with a similar distribution as false positives. This does not invalidate our results as we
made no theoretical claim about paraphrasing. We do claim that in Theorem 3.1 that the watermarked LM
ˆMand original LM Mis statistically close — in fact, indistinguishable in the “differential privacy” sense. But
the indistinguishability is for each token. As the number of tokens gets larger, they will eventually become
distinguishable, that is why our Theorem C.4 and Theorem C.13 are not contradicting Theorem 3.1. This
argument was initially pointed out by Chakraborty et al. [2023], showing that detection is possible.
Language model watermarks with provable guarantees. Concurrent to our work, Christ et al. [2023]
consider the problem of formally defining watermarking language models and propose a construction with
provable guarantees. The main differences between their work and ours are:
•In Christ et al. [2023], the watermarked distribution is computationally indistinguishable (i.e., indistinguish-
able against probabilistic polynomial-time algorithms) from the un-watermarked distribution whereas in our
case, we insist that the watermarked distribution is statistically close to the un-watermarked distribution
(of each token). The Type-I/Type-II error guarantees and the security properties are qualitatively different
in both works.
•We both use different approaches to achieve our definitions. The advantage of our construction is that
it satisfies robustness to edits property whereas they have no such guarantees. On the other hand, our
construction uses a very different set of assumptions (e.g., high entropy) on the language model and prompt
that appears to be incompatible with theirs.
•Finally, we implement our construction and conduct a thorough empirical evaluation to demonstrate its
practicality while they don’t provide any implementation of their construction.
Statistical vs Cryptographic Watermarks. Christ et al. [2023] and Aaronson [2023] are examples of
16cryptographic watermarks, while Kirchenbauer et al. [2023] and this paper study statistical watermarks.
There are several prominent differences that make it a bit challenging to compare the two kinds, but we
will try. To start, we argue that both Christ et al. [2023] and Aaronson [2023] use a similar definition of
language model watermarks as Definition 2.2 and considered a similar set of properties. Specifically, the
“soundness”, “completeness” from Christ et al. [2023] directly map to our “Type I error” and “Type II error”
requirements. As we understand from the materials in Aaronson [2023]’s talk, their “indistinguishability” is a
form of performance guarantee for ˆM. The difference to ours is that they require (in our notation)
P
ˆM(prompt )[Next token ] =E
k"
P
ˆM(prompt )[Next token |k]#
= P
M(prompt )[Next token ]
where the random key kis marginalized out. while our results require that for every kthe next token
P
ˆM(prompt )[Next token |k]≈δP
M(prompt )[Next token ]
to be statistically close (in the same sense of δ-differential privacy). By our metric, however, Aaronson [2023]’s
watermark does not appear to satisfy any nontrivial δguarantee, since it only requires unbiasedness . For
that reason, the detection guarantee and its tradeoff with quality that we discussed in Remark C.15 is not
applicable to the cryptographic watermarks.
B Additional experiment results
B.1 Empirical error rates
We perform experiments on two datasets (OpenGen and LFQA) using three different models (GPT2-XL,
OPT-1.3B, and LLaMA-7B). Table 4 presents the error rates, showcasing the sensitivity of the resulting
hypothesis test based on observed z-scores. The results demonstrate that there are no Type-I (false positive)
errors for all models, with true positive rates exceeding 0.94 for a threshold of z= 6.0.

Table 4: Empirical error rates for watermark detection using different models on two datasets. All models
employ nucleus sampling with δ= 2.0andγ= 0.5. No Type-I (false positive) errors are observed across all
models.
B.2 Different watermark parameters
We conduct an analysis to understand the impact of changing watermark strength ( δ), green list size ( γ), and
sampling methods on two datasets. The results are summarized in Table 5. When using nucleus sampling
with a fixed γ= 0.5, increasing the watermark strength resulted in higher true positive rates (TPR), but it
also led to an increase in perplexity (lower quality). Furthermore, for the same watermark strength δ, varying
the green list ratio from 0.25 to 0.5 and 0.75 showed improved detection results with smaller γ. Additionally,
we explore different decoding methods, transitioning from nucleus sampling to multinomial sampling and
beam search. Remarkably, watermark detection performed effectively with all decoding methods. It is worth
noting that the perplexity score for beam search is significantly lower than that of nucleus sampling. However,
beam search tends to generate shorter sequences with repeated words.

Table 5: Comparison of empirical error rates for watermark detection using nucleus sampling, multinomial
decoding, and beam search. Each row represents the average of 500 sequences. While sequences generated
with beam search exhibit lower perplexity, they tend to favor shorter outputs, potentially resulting in less
diverse text.
B.3 Additional robustness results
In addition to the previously discussed robustness evaluations, we provide further analysis of our method’s
resilience against paraphrasing attacks and editing attacks. The results are presented in Figure 4. Notably,
our proposed method ( Unigram-Watermark ) consistently outperforms the baseline approach (KGW+23)
across various datasets and attack scenarios. This demonstrates the superior robustness of our method in
accurately detecting watermarked text.
B.4 White-box attack
A potential attack for Unigram-Watermark is to estimate the fixed green and red list. Then the adversary
may attempt to bypass detection using these estimated lists. We conduct experiments on white-box attacks
and we find that it is difficult to accurately estimate the green list. Even if the green list is known, our
watermark is still somewhat effective thanks to our added robustness.
B.4.1 Estimating the Green List tokens
The question arises: how can the adversary estimate the green list? We simulate an adversary attempting to
learn the green list tokens by querying the model multiple times. The adversary collects token distributions
from watermarked text and compares them to natural human distributions.
In our experiment, we query the LLaMA-13B watermarked model with watermark strength δ= 2.0, watermark
ratio γ= 0.5(same setting in the paper) 2500 times, collecting 0.7 million tokens of watermarked text
generated from the prompts in LFQA and OpenGen dataset.
Then we simulate three human data distributions:

(b)Unigram-Watermark against editing attacks on OpenGen dataset with LLaMA-7B. We
vary the rates of synonym replacement, random deletion, and random swapping (0.1, 0.3, 0.5)
to demonstrate different attack scenarios.
Figure 4: ROC curves with corresponding AUC values for watermark detection against various attack
methods.
1.The human response from the same prompt (LFQA and OpenGen dataset). The corresponding human
output is 0.4 million tokens. We denote it as the “LFQA & OpenGen dataset”
2.Most times, human responses are not known. So we collect 2000 samples from the C4 [Raffel et al., 2020]
dataset to form an approximate human dataset with 1 million tokens. We denote it as the “C4 dataset”.
3.To simulate the distribution from non-native speakers. We also collect a non-native speaker (TOEFL
essay) dataset from Liang et al. [2023] with 12k tokens. We denote it as the “Non-native dataset”.
We calculate token frequencies for the three “human” datasets and the watermarked dataset. We use the
following decision rule (Algorithm 3) to decide whether a token is green or red.

The estimation results for the green list tokens are shown in the table below.
The results suggest that while it is possible to make non-trivial inferences about which token is green, it is
hard to say for sure. Notice that we are using a rather big watermark strength. For smaller and more esoteric
contexts (prompt, e.g., Non-native TOEFL dataset), such determination is harder.

B.4.2 Evasion attack (white-box and estimated)
In situations where the adversary has either an estimated version or full knowledge of the green and red lists,
they can formulate an evasion strategy. We simulate this by assuming the adversary employs WordNet from
NLTK to identify token synonyms. Tokens identified as in the green list are replaced with red list synonyms,
noting that some tokens may not have synonyms or may only have green synonyms.

Table 6: Evasion attack results: analysis of detection AUC and perplexity.
The results in Table 6 show it is difficult to evade detection even with known green list tokens. The detection
AUC for the watermarked text is still somewhat high. In addition, the honest attempt to evade the attack by
automatic synonym replacement has led to a significant drop in the text quality.

original paper. For LLaMA-65B, due to computational constraints, we test on a sample of 100 sentences.

C Main theoretical results with proofs
In this section, we state and prove the guarantees for Unigram-Watermark which certifies the required qual-
ity, correctness, and security properties of a language model watermarking scheme from Definition 2.2.
Symbols and mathematical notations. We use P[·],E[·],P[·|·]andE[·|·]to denote the probability,
expectation operator, conditional probability and conditional expectation respectively. Whenever there
is ambiguity on which distribution the random variables are drawn from, we explicitly state them, e.g.,
P(X,Y)∼D[X < 3|Y=y], or equivalently P[X < 3|Y=y; (X, Y)∼ D]. To avoid clutter, we do not
distinguish between random variables and constants as the distinctions are clear from the context. Boldface
symbols denote a vector, e.g., a probability mass function por a sequence of tokens y.∥ · ∥ 2,∥ · ∥∞denotes
the standard ℓ2andℓ∞-norms of a vector. In addition, [n]is a shorthand for {1,2, ..., n}. Other symbols and
their meanings will be defined as we encounter them.
C.1 Quality guarantees
We start by providing a strong utility analysis of the watermarked language model than the “perplexity”
bound from [Kirchenbauer et al., 2023]. Our results work for the entire family of Rényi-divergence and imply
guarantees in Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence and Total Variation-distance.
The Renyi-divergence of two distributions P,Qis defined as
Dα 
P∥Q
=1
α−1logE
x∼Q
(dP
dQ)α
wheredP
dQis the Radon–Nikodym derivative. When α→1, the Renyi divergence converges to the KL-
divergence. Additionally, when α= 0.5, it serves as an upper bound for the TV-distance.
On the technical level, we leverage a surprising connection to a modern machinery developed in the differential
privacy literature known as “bounded range” analysis [Dong et al., 2020] of the classical exponential mechanism
[McSherry and Talwar, 2007].
Theorem C.1 (Restatement of Theorem 3.1) .Consider has the input to the language model at step t,
denoted as h= [x,y1:t−1]. Fix green list G. Let δrepresent the watermark strength. For any h, the α-th
order Renyi-divergence between the watermarked probability distribution ˆpt=ˆpt(·|h)at time step tand the
original probability distribution pt=pt(·|h)satisfies:
∀h,max 
Dα ˆpt∥pt
, Dα 
pt∥ˆpt
≤min{δ, αδ2/8}.
Proof.We define δv= 0when v∈Randδv=δwhen v∈G. Using this definition, we have:
ˆp(v|h) =exp(ℓv+δv)P
wexp(ℓw+δw)≤exp(δ) exp( ℓv)
exp(−δ)P
wexp(ℓw)=e2δp(v|h)
Similarly, ˆp(v|h)≥e−2δp(v|h).
21Consequently, ˆpandpare2δ-closeintermsofmax-divergence,whichcanbeinterpretedas (ϵ,˜δ)-indistinguishable,
similar to the concept of Differential Privacy [Dwork et al., 2006] with ˜δ= 0andϵ= 2δ.
Additionally, ˆp(v|h)andp(v|h)satisfy δ-BoundedRange (Proposition 1 in Dong et al. [2020]) with parameter
δ, since the changes to ℓvis monotonic. Lemma 3.2 in Cesar and Rogers [2021] shows that δ-Bounded Range
implies δ2/8-concentrated differential privacy, which says that Dα(ˆp∥p)≤δ2α
8for all α≥1(where Dα
represents Rényi Divergence of order α). Specifically, when α= 1, the KL-divergence satisfies DKL(ˆp∥p)≤δ2
8.
Furthermore, δ-BoundedRange implies δ-DP (or rather (δ,0)-indistinguishability, since we are dealing with
just two distributions rather than a family of neighbor distributions). It follows from the that
DKL(ˆp∥p)≤D∞(ˆp∥p)≤δ
Corollary C.2. For any prompt x, the KL-divergence between the probability distribution of the watermarked
sequence and the original sequence satisfies:
∀x,max{DKL ˆp(y1:n|x)∥p(y1:n|x)
, DKL 
p(y1:n|x)∥ˆp(y1:n|x)
} ≤αmin{nδ, nδ2/8}
Proof.The proof follows from the adaptive composition theorem for Renyi-divergence, and max-divergence
(from the DP literature) for the autoregressive decomposition of ˆp(y1:n|x)andp(y1:n|x)and then invoke
Theorem 3.1 for each factor.
C.2 Robustness / Security guarantees
In this section, we provide the proof for Theorems 3.7, D.1, and 3.1 to ensure completeness and precision. We
begin by restating the theorems and providing the corresponding proofs with necessary modifications.
Theorem C.3 (Robustness to editing (Restatement of Theorem 3.7) ) .Lety=[y1, . . . , y n]represent
the watermarked sequence. Suppose the adversary Afollows Definition 2.2 and outputs a modified text
u=[u1, . . . , u m]. Following Equation 2, we calculate z-score zyandzu. Assume edit distance between yand
u(denoted as η) satisfies η < n. Then we have
zu≥zy−max{(1 +γ/2)η√n,(1−γ/2)η√n−η}.
In particular, when η≤2γn
(1+γ/2)2, we can drop the second term in the max.
Proof.Define bivariate function f(x, y) =x−γy√y. By Taylor’s theorem
f(x−kx, y−ky) =f(x, y) +
∂xf(x−˜kxy−˜ky)
∂yf(x−˜kxy−˜ky)T
−kx
−ky
=f(x, y)−
kxq
y−˜ky−γky
2q
y−˜ky

where ˜kxis between 0andkxand˜kyis between 0andky. We also know that |kx| ≤kand|ky| ≤k.
A lower bound of the above can be obtained by finding an upper bound to
kxq
y−˜ky−γky
2q
y−˜ky=kx−γ
2kyq
y−˜ky
First observe that we can always choose kx=k. Next we discuss two possibilities of ky. Ifkyis negative,
then choosing ky=−kand˜k= 0maximizes the bound, which gives(1+γ/2)k√y.
22Ifkyis positive, then we should always choose ˜ky=kyto maximize the expression, which gives us an upper
bound of
k−γ
2kyp
y−ky=k+γ
2(y−ky)−γ
2yp
y−ky=k−γ
2yp
y−ky+γp
y−ky
2.
We will discuss two cases again, the first case is when k−γy/2≤0. In this case, the function g(u) =a/u+bu
with a≤0has a derivative of −a/u2+b≥0, thus gis monotonically increasing. Thus we should choose
ky= 0. The second case is when k−γy/2>0, in this case the a >0in the above g(u)andg(u)is convex,
thusmax umin≤u≤umaxg(u) =max{g(umax), g(umin)}. Thus we should just compare the two cases when ky= 0
andky=k, i.e., max{k√y,(1−γ/2)k√y−k}.
Collect everything together, we get an upper bound o
max{(1 +γ/2)k√y,k√y,(1−γ/2)k√y−k}= max(1 +γ/2)k√y,(1−γ/2)k√y−k
i.e.,
f(x−kx, y−ky)−f(x, y)≥ −max(1 +γ/2)k√y,(1−γ/2)k√y−k
.
Now notice that our z-score has the same form as the f(x, y)function. We can take y=nandx=|y|G.
Instantiate kbe the maximum number of edits η. Observe that given that the adversary has a bounded edit
distance, each operation of “insertion”, “deletion”, or “edit” can, at most, alter one token from the green list to
the red list. They also can only alter the length by the number of edits. The above result translates into
zu≥zy−max{(1 +γ/2)η√n,(1−γ/2)η√n−η},
where ηdenotes the edit distance between yandu.
The robustness theorem above implies the security guarantees as we discussed in Corollary C.23.

green list, thus by the linearity of the expectation and the independence of yinG.
E[|y|G|y] =nX
i=1E[1(yi∈G)|y] =nX
i=1γ=γn.
23Next, we will prove the second statement by applying Lemma F.1 to obtain the result stated in the third
statement. Let ai,j=1(j≤γN)Pn
ℓ=11(yℓ=i). By our assumption 0≤ai,j≤Cmaxfor all i, j. Observe
thatPN
i=1ai,ΠN(i)isidentically distributed with|y|G.
By Lemma F.1 with t= 16 log(8 e1/16/α), we get that with probability 1−α,
||y|G−γn|<2r
16 log(9 /α)
NNγnV + 16Cmaxlog(9/α)
where we used that 8e1/16≤9and the fact that only γNcolumns of the ai,jmatrix ai,jis nonzero, and for
each non-zero column L2-norm of the column is bounded by√
nVby our definition of V. The result for the
z-score follows trivially.
Remark C.5 (Wide applicability) .Note that the theorem does not impose assumptions on how yis generated.
It covers any procedure (including human generation) that produces yin a manner independently of the
secret partition G. In cases where yis generated by a language model, it could be the output of greedy search
fromp(yt|x,y1:t−1), nucleus sampling, beam search, or any other decoding methods.
RemarkC.6 (Diversity parameters) .TheVandCmaxparameters in Theorem C.4 measure the diversity of the
suspect text yand are necessary for the high-probability bound. As an example, if the prompt says “ Repeat
“Goal” for a hundred thousand times like a soccer commentator. ” Then the resulting generated
sequence will be “ Goal goal goal ... ”, and has either ngreen tokens or 0green tokens. No meaningful
Type I error bound can be obtained.
Remark C.7 (Controlling false positive rate) .The theorem implies that if we choose τ >q
64Vlog(9/α)
1−γ+
16Cmaxlog(9/α)√
nγ(1−γ), then the false-positive rate is smaller than α. Note that VandCmaxcan be computed directly
from y, allowing us to choose an input-dependent τas a function of V, C maxthat achieves a α-Type I error
guarantee with a fixed αfor all inputs. In particular, the Type I error αdecreases exponentially as we
increase the threshold τ.
C.4 Only true detection (Type II error guarantees)
For bounding the Type II error, i.e., false negative rates, we will work with our proposed method that
generates yfrom the language model, i.e., sampling from the watermarked distribution ˆprecursively one
token at a time.
Let’s first recall a few notations. his the input to the language model at step t, i.e., h= [x,y1:t−1]. Let
δrepresent the watermark strength from Equation 1. The green list G⊂[N]is a random index set of the
vocabulary of size γN. The watermarked probability distribution ˆpt=ˆpt(·|h)at time step t. The process of
generating the sentence y1, y2, . . . , y ninvolves recursively sampling from ˆpt, which we refer to as a “roll-out”
procedure.
We need to make a few assumptions about the language model’s probability distribution pand the prompt x.
We will first state them and then explain why these are natural and arguably needed for the Type II error to
be small.
C.4.1 On-average high entropy assumption
The first such assumption requires the probability of the roll-out to be “sufficiently diverse” on average. We
will introduce the notation ∥p∥2:=qPN
i=1p[i]2.
Assumption C.8 (On-average-high-entropy) .We say a language model’s probability distribution pwith a
prompt xsatisfies ξ-on-average-high-entropy if
1
nnX
t=1E
y1:t−1∼p(·|x)[∥pt∥2]≤ξ.
24This assumption requires the distribution of the roll-out to be sufficiently diffuse on average (either in
expectation or with high probability).
The purpose of these assumptions is to rule out the cases when y1:nis almost deterministic under pand
perturbing the logits by δdoes not change the distribution much at all.
For example, if the prompt writes
“Generate the English alphabet in capital letters for 200 times please. ”
Then the language model would generate
“ABC...XYZ, ABC...XYZ, ... ”.
Despite that the generated sequence is very long, i.e., nis as large as 5,200, the added watermark does not
change the distribution very much at all. To see this, if p(y3=“C”|x,h)≥1−ϵfor a tiny ϵ, and then by our
quality guarantee, ˆp(y3=“C”|x,h)≥1−ϵeδ.
Quantitatively, for nearly uniform pt,ξ=O(1/N), ifptconcentrates on a single token for all t, e.g., when a
football commentator exclaims “ Goal goal goal goal .... ”, then we cannot obtain a better bound than
the trivial ξ≤1. In the alphabet example above ξ≤1/26.
Why is it called entropy? Assumption C.8 is related to the “high-entropy” assumption in Kirchenbauer
et al. [2023] but for a slightly different kind of entropy. In a more formal sense, the quantity ∥pt∥2is connected
to the Tsallis entropy of order 2, defined as S2(pt) =kB(1− ∥pt∥2)where kBis known as the Boltzmann
constant. Our assumption requires the expected Tsallis entropy of the conditional distribution ptover the
roll-out of pto be larger than kB(1−ξ)on average among t= 1, ..., n.
For a high-probability result, we also need a stronger version.
Assumption C.9 (On-average-high-entropy (high probability)) .We say that a language model’s probability
distribution pwith a prompt xsatisfies (ξ, β)-on-average-high-entropy if with probability at least 1−βover
the generated sequence y1:n,
1
nmax(nX
t=1pt,nX
t=1∥pt∥2,nX
t=1pt
∞,nX
t=1∥pt∥2
∞)
≤ξ.
The behavior is similar to that of the expectation version of the assumption. When ptis nearly uniform,
pt[i] =O(1/N), then ξ=O(1/√
N). When ptis supported only on one token, then ξ= 1. In practice, ξis a
small constant. As we will present in the main theorem, as long as ξ≍δ, the number of green list tokens is
guaranteed to grow faster γnasngets larger.
One may also ask whether it is necessary to make entropy assumptions on the conditional probabilities instead
of the marginal probabilities induced by porˆp, but this is unfortunately not sufficient as illustrated in the
following example.
Example C.10 (Marginal high entropy is insufficient) .Let the prompt xbe
“Generate the first token uniformly at random, then repeat the token you generated for
the remaining n−1tokens”.
In this case, a good language model that follows the instruction will have Pp(yt=i) = 1 /Nfor all iand all
t= 1, ..., nmarginally, whichimpliesthattheentropyisthemaximumandforanygreenlist G,Pp(yt∈G) =γ.
On the other hand, with probability γ,|y|G=nand with probability 1−γ,|y|G= 0. There isn’t any
concentration around γnpossible. Moreover, check that if we apply watermark, then Pˆp(yt∈G) =γeδ
γeδ+(1−γ)
for all tand all G. This changes the probability of seeing |y|G=nslightly but the two world remains
indistinguishable.
25C.4.2 A “homophily” assumption
The second assumption that we need to make is called “homophily”, which says that increasing the probability
of a group of tokens by adding the watermarks will not decrease the probability of generating the same group
of tokens in the future as the language model rolls out.
Assumption C.11 (“Homophily”) .We say a language model’s probability distribution pand prompt x
satisfy “homophily” if for any G, the corresponding watermarked ˆpsatisfies that
E
h∼ˆp(·|x)
P
y∼ˆp(·|h,x)(y∈G)
≥E
h∼p(·|x)
P
y∼ˆp(·|h,x)(y∈G)
where hdenotes the generated sequence before y.
This assumption says that by increasing the probability of tokens in G, the induced distribution of the prefix
hcannot counter-intuitively reduce the probability of tokens in Gin the future on average.
The assumption is not unreasonable, because we expect a language model to be more likely to refer to text it
has generated in the prefix than those that did not appear in the prefix.
This “homophily” assumption is needed to rule out the unnatural situation where increasing the green list
tokens initially ends up reducing the number of green list tokens in the long run. To illustrate this, consider
the following example utilizing the prompt:
x=“Randomly select a color, state what it is. Then write a short poem about it without
naming this color at all. ”
The generated text from a commercial language model is
“Color choice: green. Emerald whispers in the meadow’s sway, Life’s verdant rhythm in
ceaseless play. It cradles the world in a leafy embrace, A silent serenade to nature’s
grace.”
Notice that if the token “ green”∈G, it increases the probability of the language model generating “ green”
at the beginning. However, regardless of the text’s length, the subsequent portion of the generated text will
not contain the word “ green”, as instructed by the prompt. This decreases the expected number of times the
token “green” appears.
To hammer it home, consider the following more quantitative construction of that works no matter which
random green list Grealizes.
x=“Choose the first k token by random sampling without replacement. Then sample from
all but the token you choose uniformly for n-k rounds. ”
It’s easy to calculate that the expected number of times any token appears in a language model that perfectly
follows the instruction will be n/N. However, the watermarked language model, let’s say we use a very large
δsuch that the first ktokens are from the green list, then the expected number of times a green-list token
appears isk

N−kwhich is bounded by 1ifk=γNinstead of growing linearly in nas in
the original language model.
Toobtainaconcentrationbound, wealsoneedastrongerversionofthehomophilyassumptionasfollows.
Assumption C.12 (High probability on-average homophily) .There exists a coupling – a joint distribution
ofy1:nandˆy1:nwhere marginally y1:n∼p(·|x),ˆy1:n∼ˆp(·|x)– such that for any G, with probability 1−β
over the joint distribution,
1
nnX
t=1ˆpt(G|ˆy1:t−1))≥1
nnX
t=1ˆpt(G|y1:t−1)).
The reason for defining the existence of a coupling is for technical reasons, but the purpose of the assumption
is identical to that of the in-expectation version.
26C.5 Theorem statement on “Only true detection”
Now we are ready to state the main theorem.
Theorem C.13 (Only true detection) .For a fixed language model Mand a prompt x. The sentence y1:n

or equivalently E[zy]≥κ(eδ−1)p

2.Assume high-probability version of homophily (Assumption C.12). There exists a parameter Cδ,γthat

RemarkC.14 (ExponentiallysmallTypeIandTypeIIerrorguarantees) .RecallthataccordingtoTheoremC.4,
in order to have a false positive rate controlled at level α, we need to set the threshold τ≳p
log(1/α)for
sufficiently high-entropy sequences. Theorem C.13 says that if we want the false negative rate to be smaller
than β, we only need the threshold τ≲κδnunder similar (slightly different) high-entropy sequences for
n≳log(1/β)/δ2. Observe that there is a wide range of valid choices of τfor us to have a detection algorithm
that does not make Type I or Type II error with high probability. These observations together suggest that
we can afford to choose δ≍1/√nif the sequence is sufficiently high-entropy.
Remark C.15 (Information-theoretic optimality) .The sample complexity of n≳1/δ2is information-
theoretically optimal (up to a logarithmic factor) in δbecause, our accuracy guarantee (together with
the composition theorem) indicates that the KL-divergence between a sequence of length ngenerated from
pand that generated from ˆpisnδ2indistinguishable, i.e., n >1/δ2for any classifier — even the uniform
most-powerful Neyman-Pearson likelihood-ratio test (which requires additional information, e.g., xandp
which we do not have) — to make no mistakes with a constant probability.
27C.6 Proof of Theorem C.13
In the false negative error cases, yis drawn from the watermarked language model ˆM. To be explicit, let us
write y= [ˆy1, ...,ˆyn] =ˆy1:n. Now let’s also define a hypothetical (possibly coupled) sequence y1:nwhich is
drawn from the original (un-watermarked) language model M.
For convenience, we define the following shorthand p(G) :=Py∼p[y∈G].for a probability mass function p
defined on the vocabulary V. Specifically, ˆpt(G|ˆy1:t−1)means Py∼ˆpt(·|x,ˆy1:t−1)[y∈G],parameterized by a
fixed green list G. Similarly, pt(G|y1:t−1)denotes Py∼pt(·|x,y1:t−1)[y∈G].
The proof of Theorem C.13 considers the following decomposition
|y|G=|y|G−X
tˆpt(G|ˆy1:t−1) (5)
+X
tˆpt(G|ˆy1:t−1)−X
tˆpt(G|y1:t−1) (6)
+X
tˆpt(G|y1:t−1) (7)
steps to prove a lower bound to each of the three terms. We will start with the high probability bound (the
second statement in Theorem C.13) then deal with the expectation.
C.6.1 Many green list tokens with high probability
To obtain a high-probability lower bound, it requires us to obtain concentration for each of the three terms.
Specifically,
1.To bound Term (5), we use Lemma C.16 which invokes Martingale concentration over the randomness in
yto show |y|Gis close toP
tˆpt(G|ˆy1:t−1).
2.We will show Term (6)is non-negative with high probability by using the homophily assumption (Assump-
tion C.12). This allows us to study the roll-out ˆy1:t−1under ˆM(x)(orˆp) by studying a hypothetical
alternative roll-out y1:t−1sampled under M(x)(orp).
3.Then we control Term (7)by first Taylor expanding it into quantities involving pt(G|y1:t−1)instead of
ˆp(G|y1:t−1), then apply concentration inequalities for each expanded terms over the randomness of G
(while fixing y1:t−1) to obtain a high probability lower bound. Proposition C.19 gives the results.
We start by tackling (5) via Martingale concentration.
Lemma C.16. For any green list Gand prompt x.

Proof.We fix Gand construct a martingale sequence X1, X2, ..., X nwhere X0= 0and:
Xt=Xt−1+1(yt∈G)− P
yt∼ˆp(·|x,y1:t−1)[yt∈G].
Check that E[Xt|y1:t−1] =Xt−1. The underlying filtration is the sigma-field generated by y1:t.
The claim about the expectation follows from that X0= 0and an inductive argument following the tower
property of conditional probabilities.
28By the fact that |Xt−Xt−1| ≤1we can apply Azuma-Hoeffding’s inequality and get
P[|Xn−E[Xn]| ≥u]≤2e−u2
2n.
Check that by an inductive argument E[Xn] = 0. So we get that with probability at least 1−δ

To handle (6), we apply Assumption C.12 with parameter β/3, which says that with probability 1−β/3
(6)≥0. This converts a roll-out from ˆy∼ˆpto a roll-out from the original p.
Before we deal with (7), let us write a lemma that rewrites ˆpt(G|y1:t−1)into a more convenient form.
Lemma C.17. For any t,ht. Fix G. Denote short hands ˆp(G) :=Pyt∼ˆpt(·|x,ht)[yt∈G]andp(G) :=
Pyt∼pt(·|x,ht)[yt∈G].

p(G).
The lemma implies that ˆp(G)≥p(G)and that if p(G)is bounded away from 1,ˆp(G)≥(1+O(δ))p(G).
Lemma C.18. For any t,ht. Fix G.
ˆp(G)≥eδγ

(1 + ( eδ−1)˜x)3(x−γ)2
where ˜x∈[x, γ]is a function of x. By relaxing ˜xto0we obtain the lower bound as claimed.
Now we are ready to handle (7) with high probability in the following proposition.

We will now apply Lemma F.1 to lowerbound (∗)with high probability and to bound the absolute value of
(∗∗)with high probability.
Remark C.20.The reason why we can apply these lemmas even after we condition on y1:t−1is due to the
“high-probability homophily” assumption which allows us to use the fact that y1:t−1is independent to G, i.e.,
the distribution of the green list remains uniform at random after we condition on each qualifying y1:t−1
separately.

same result under probability 1−˜β.
30C.6.2 Many green list tokens in expectation
To obtain the lower bound in expectation, we just need to bound the expectation of (5),(6)and(7).
1. Observe that E[Term (5) |G] = 0(from Lemma C.16)
2. Also, observe that (6) ≥0under the homophily assumption (Assumption C.11).
3.Term(7)can be further lower bounded by a second-order Taylor expansion argument (Lemma C.18) and
a variance calculation for sampling without replacement (Lemma C.21), which ends up depending on the
on-average high-entropy parameter from Definition C.8. The formal result is stated in Proposition C.22.

In comparison, the best bound on the security property parameter one can obtain for the scheme of

To say it differently, our method, Unigram-Watermark , utilizing a fixed Green-Red split, achieves twice
the robustness to edits compared to Kirchenbauer et al. [2023]’s baseline approach.
D Analysis of Kirchenbauer et al. [2023]
D.1 Soft watermarking scheme of Kirchenbauer et al. [2023]
This section illustrates the soft watermarking scheme proposed by Kirchenbauer et al. [2023]. This straight-
forward algorithm only requires access to the language model’s logits at each time step. Let y=[y1, . . . , y n]
represent the output sentence of language model Mgiven the prompt x. The watermarking scheme generates
y1:nby hashing yt−1to a partition of the token space (Green List and Red List) and amplifies the probability
of tokens on the Green List. Specifically, [y1, . . . , y n]is derived from the following Markov chain:
1.y1∼Softmax 
logitsM 
y1=·|x
2. For t= 2 : n,
yt∼Softmax 
logitsM(yt=·|[x, y1. . . , y t−1]) +δ1(· ∈Green (yt−1))
Typically, γ|V|tokens are selected to form a Green List, where γsymbolizes the fraction of tokens to be
watermarked (by default, γ= 0.5). The logit value for each green token is augmented by a constant δ(default
value = 2), which denotes the watermark strength. This elevation enhances the likelihood of sampling green,
watermarked tokens, particularly for high-entropy distributions.
Validation of whether a text was generated by a watermarked language model is achievable given knowledge
of the hash function and tokenizer. The adversary constructs u=[u1, . . . , u m]from x,y1:nand any auxiliary
input. The detection algorithm calculates the quantity of green tokens |u|G=Pm
t=21(ut∈Green (ut−1)).
One can assume the null hypothesis, denoted as H0: The text sequence is produced independently of the green
list rule. Following this, a z-statistic score is computed as z=(|u|G−γm)/p
mγ(1−γ). If the z-score
exceeds a predetermined threshold, the algorithm declares, “This was generated from ˆM!”.
32D.2 Security property of Kirchenbauer et al. [2023]
We also demonstrate the robustness property of the soft watermarking algorithm in Kirchenbauer et al. [2023]
in the following Theorem D.1
Theorem D.1 (Robustness to editing in the watermarking scheme of Kirchenbauer et al. [2023]) .Let
y=[y1, . . . , y n]represent the watermarked sequence. Suppose the adversary Afollows the definition 2.2
and outputs a modified text u=[u1, . . . , u m]. Following Equation 2, we calculate the z-score of the soft
watermarking Kirchenbauer et al. [2023] zyandzu. Then we have
zu≥zy−max{(2 +γ/2)η√n,(2−γ/2)η√n−η}.
Proof.The proof is similar to that of Theorem 3.7 except that the maximum perturbation to |y|Gis now 2η
rather than η. We now justify that the maximum perturbation has really doubled below, but ignore the part
that is the same as in the proof of Theorem 3.7.
LetBiGrams (u) ={{u1, u2},{u2, u3}, ...,{un−1, un}}and similarly BiGrams (y)enumerates the set of all two
grams in sequence y1:m.
We claim that each edit can modify at most two elements in the above set. To see this, consider “insertion”,
“deletion”, and “edit” separately.
•If we “insert” one token ˜uatt, then {ut−1, ut}and{ut, ut+1}become {ut−1,˜u},{˜u, ut}and{ut, ut+1}.
Only one element of BiGrams (u)is modified — {ut−1, ut}.
•For “deletion” at t,{ut−1, ut}and{ut, ut+1}become {ut−1, ut+1}. So two elements from BiGrams (u)are
gone.
•For “edit” at t,{ut−1, ut}and{ut, ut+1}become {ut−1,˜u}and{˜u, ut+1}. Thus again only two elements
from BiGrams (u)are gone.
It follows that when yis obtained after up to ηedits
|BiGrams (u)∩BiGrams (y)| ≥ |BiGrams (u)| −2η
Observe thatPn
t=21(ut∈Green (ut−1))counts the number of qualifying elements in BiGrams (u), which
completes the proof.
For this reason, our watermark is twice as robust as that of Kirchenbauer et al. [2023]. This
provides the theoretical guarantee to our empirical results presented in the experiments!
Remark D.2.We can view our watermark as a trivial Markovian watermarking scheme with k= 0, and
what Kirchenbauer et al. [2023] proposed to be k= 1. For the more general k-Markovian watermarking
scheme that depends on a prefix of length k, the robustness deteriorates by a factor of k, as the maximum
perturbation will become((k+1)+ γ/2)η√n. To say it differently, choosing k= 0gives the maximum robustness
and maximum simplicity at the same time, and the benefit leads to significant gains in our experiments,
especially against paraphrasing attacks.
E Alternative detector “Unique” and its desirable properties
Our theoretical analysis suggests a promising alternative Detectalgorithm for Unigram-Watermark that
simply involves calling Algorithm 2 with a deduplicated y.
The simple change actually results in a number of interesting new properties. For example, we can state its
Type I error bound a lot more cleanly now as a Corollary of Theorem C.4
33Algorithm 4 Unigram-Watermark :Detect(Alternative)
1:Input:suspect text y, watermark detection key k, threshold τ.
2:Output: 1 or 0 (whether the text is watermarked).
3:Return Algorithm 2 with suspect text Unique( y), detection key kand threshold τ.
Corollary E.1 (No false positive for Deduplicated Detection) .Consider y=y1:nas anyfixedsuspect text.
Letm=|Unique (y)|be the number of unique tokens in y. Let Gbe selected through Algorithm 1, using a
uniform random choice. Then the following statements hold true:
1. Assume m≥1, then
E[|Unique( y)|G|y] =γnand E[zUnique( y)|y] = 0.
2. With probability 1−α(over only the randomness of G),

The above gives a clean finite-sample concentration bound of the Type I error using Algorithm 4. Notably,
while deduplicating reduces the length of the suspect text, i.e., m < n, it improves the bound by ensuring
both CmaxandVare1.
Remark E.2 (Asymptotic choice of τfor controlling false positives) .Lemma C.21 gives that
Var [|Unique( y)|G|y] =mγ(1−γ)(1−m−1
N−1)
i.e., the conditional variance of zUnique( y)is(1−m−1
N−1). This means that if we want to control the asymptotic
false positive rate to α, all we have to do is to choose the threshold τto be
τ=r
1−m−1

where Φis the standard normal CDF.
Type II error. How about Type II error? Our results in Theorem C.13 are still applicable but require
us to apply that with a special language model derived from the original that directly generates Unique (y)
(ordered in the same order they appear in y). This is still a valid autoregressive language model but has
different roll-out probabilities.

“Unique” in K-gram watermark section with K≥2.Clearly, the same idea of deduplication works
for the whole family of K-gram watermark proposed in Kirchenbauer et al. [2023]. In fact, it was briefly
mentioned in a remark from their paper as a mitigation measure to reduce correlation. All arguments we
make about Type I error and Robustness to Edits above work for K≥2. We defer the Type II error bound
for this family to a longer version of the paper.

with varied lengths. We then use the dynamic threshold τwith different choices of αas shown in Equation 9.
By choosing different random seeds, we obtain different green lists. The results in Figure 5 show the empirical
false positive rate aligns well with the theoretical α.
E.1Alternative detection “Unique” is robust to Emoji attack and other tricky
attacks
Kirchenbauer et al. [2023] discussed a number of interesting attacks on the K-gram watermarks. In this
section, we inspect the robustness of Unigram-Watermark (with both Algorithm 2 and 4 as Detect) to
these attacks.
We will focus on those trickier generative attacks, as those non-generative attacks on the surface level (e.g.,
synonym substitution, Unicode substitution) were rather satisfactorily addressed in Kirchenbauer et al. [2023].
The same arguments work for Unigram-Watermark . However, there are trickier ones that break K-gram
watermarks for K≥2but not for K= 1, especially when we use Algorithm 4 for detection.
Emoji attack the Emoji attack, also known as the Pineapple attack, asks the language model to inject
a special symbol, e.g., an Emoji, in between the actual text that the LM is supposed to generate in
response to a prompt. For example, a user of the language model can prompt an LM with “ Write
my college admission essay. Insert an emoji in between every word. ”. Then the user can
simply remove the artificially injected symbol before submitting the essay. Clearly, this attack breaks all
K-gram watermarks for K > 1[Kirchenbauer et al., 2023] (but also [Aaronson, 2023]). Our Unigram-
Watermark remains effective because half of the tokens in yare still watermarked. The repeated
Emoji symbol with length n/2is a problem for both Type I and Type II error, but after “Unique”, this
corresponds to just an Edit Distance of 1onUnique( y)!
Alphabet attack We can also make the Emoji attack stronger by injecting a known sequence of “alphabets”
instead of one single symbol. For example, “ Write my college admission essay. Insert, in
the order of the vocabulary, a token in between every word you generate. ”. The alphabet
35attack breaks K-gram watermarks in the same way an Emoji attack does, but since the added tokens
are different, “Unique” does not solve it right away. Interestingly, despite m/2of the tokens in Unique (y)
are not watermarked, as long as the Alphabet being used is independent of the secret key, it does not
change the Type I error and only slightly reduces the power (i.e., 1-Type II error) since the expected
number of Green tokens in that m/2injected tokens is mγ/2.
Stegnography attack One may extend the attack even further by asking the language model to encode a
message, which swaps each token in the vocabulary with another token through a secret codebook. For
example, whenever you want to output Token i, output Token mod(i+ 1, N)instead. If the “code book”
is supplied in the prompt with an instruction for the LM to follow the code book when generating the
text, then it really breaks all watermarks including ours, while allowing the user who knows the code
book to easily revert it to the original text. The issue of such an attack is that it requires significantly
heavy-lifting for the language model to predict outside the typical distribution it is trained on. There is
no real risk of such an attack being employed as it is likely to significantly reduce the quality of the
generated text.
To be clear, these attacks are, in fact, not post-processing-based evasion attacks, but rather hacks into
prompts. Nevertheless, our watermark that is robust to edits turns out to be quite resilient to them.
