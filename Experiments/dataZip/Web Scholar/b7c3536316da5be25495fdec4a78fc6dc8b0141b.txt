Electromagnetic induction can effectively induce abundant ﬁring patterns in
neurons. In modeling a neuron model with the electromagnetic inductioneffect, an electromagnetic induction current is frequently added to the state
equation of membrane potential. To more properly re ﬂect the non-uniform
distribution of the ions inside and outside the neuron membrane, an ideal ﬂux-
controlled memristor with sinusoidal memductance function and non-linearlymodulated input is raised to depict an electromagnetic induction effect on aHindmarsh –Rose neuron model, and thereby, a three-dimensional (3D)
memristive Hindmarsh –Rose (mHR) neuron model is built in this paper. The
proposed mHR neuron model possesses no equilibrium point since theinvolvement of the ideal ﬂux-controlled memristor, which induces the
generation of hidden dynamics. Numerical results declare that the mHR
neuron model can generate abundant hidden dynamics, i.e., periodic spiking,chaotic spiking, period-doubling bifurcation route, tangent bifurcation, and chaoscrisis. These hidden dynamics are much related to the memristor couplingstrength and externally applied stimulus. Afterward, the memristor initialcondition-offset boosting behavior is revealed. This can trigger the generationof in ﬁnite multiple coexisting ﬁring patterns along the memristor variable
coordinate. These coexisting ﬁring patterns have identical attractor topology
but different locations in the phase plane. Finally, an analog circuit is designed
for implementing the mHR neuron model, and PSIM-based circuit simulation isexecuted. The circuit-simulated results perfectly verify the generation of hiddeninﬁnite multiple coexisting initial condition-offset boosting ﬁring patterns in the
proposed mHR neuron model.

1 Introduction
The nervous system contains a huge number of biological neurons, which are the basic
information handling and integrating units of a biological nervous system [ 1]. The
dynamical properties of these biological neurons are crucial for determining the
behaviors of the nervous systems [ 2,3]. Thus, modeling of the biological neuron and
exploring its dynamical behaviors are research hotspots and attract many researchers ’
attention. Up to date, numerous neuron models have been constructed to depict differentOPEN ACCESS

DOI10.3389/fphy.2023.1160419kinds of biological neurons, and they can roughly be divided into
two categories, i.e., the continuous-time neuron model [ 4–10] and
discrete-time map [ 11–13]. In the literature, some of the
continuous-time neuron models were built based on theelectrophysiological ion transport mechanism [ 4–7]. In addition,
some continuous-time neuron models [ 8–10] and discrete-time
maps [ 11,13] were built on dynamical assumptions to reproduce
electrical activities without regard to the neuron structure [ 14]. No
matter which category they are, all these neuron models caneffectively reproduce abundant ﬁring patterns in response to the
change of the electrophysiological environment. Recently, theelectromagnetic induction effect has immersed great scientists ’
concern, which can greatly affect the neuron dynamics [ 15–17]
and neural network behaviors [ 18,19].
Actually, the media of a biological neuron can be magnetized
during its polarizing and depolarizing processes [ 20]. On one hand,
periodic ﬁring can control the transition, pumping, and distribution
of calcium, potassium, chloride, etc., ions in these processes. On theother hand, the distribution, pumping, and transition of these ionscan induce ﬂuctuation of the membrane potential. Meanwhile, the
electromagnetic induction effect is induced when the ions passthrough the neuron membrane. Thus, ion channel currents and
the electromagnetic induction current simultaneously affect the
membrane potential. In the literature, ﬂux-controlled memristors
were used in various neuron models to depict the dynamic relationbetween the membrane potential and magnetic ﬂux [21]. In other
words, the ﬂux-controlled memristors were used in the
Hodgkin –Huxley neuron model [ 22–24], Izhikevich neuron
model [ 25], FitzHugh –Nagumo neuron model [ 26], and three-
dimensional (3D) [ 27–31]/two dimensional (2D) [ 32–34]
Hindmarsh –Rose neuron model to depict the electromagnetic
induction effect. These memristive neuron models can generateabundant ﬁring patterns since the involvement of the ﬂux-controlled
memristor. To explain in detail, these ﬂux-controlled memristors are
non-ideal with a quadratic polynomial memductance function
[22–30,32,33] and ideal with hypertangent/sinusoidal/cosinoidal
memductance functions [ 20,31,33]. It is worth noting that the state
equations of these memristors are linearly controlled by a membrane
potential. Actually, the membrane potential possesses non-linear
regulation on magnetization since the non-uniform distribution ofthe ions inside and outside the neuron membrane. To stress thisissue, an ideal ﬂux-controlled memristor with a sinusoidal
memductance function and non-linear modulation on amemristor magnetic ﬂux is raised to availably depict the
electromagnetic induction effect in this paper.
The Hindmarsh –Rose neuron model is a simple kind of neuron
model built on dynamical assumptions, which can reproduce main
ﬁring patterns of the biological neuron [ 9]. In the literature, the
memristive Hindmarsh –Rose (mHR) neuron models with ideal
memristors can easily generate multistability with coexistingﬁring patterns. In this case, the mHR neuron model has no
equilibrium point, which induces the occurrence of hiddendynamics [ 20]. In particular, the initial condition-offset boosting
behavior is triggered since the involved ideal ﬂux-controlled
memristor possessing sinusoidal/cosinoidal memductance
functions [ 20,34,35], which is very different from the
parameter-offset boosting behavior [ 36–38]. This induces the
occurrence of extreme multistability with in ﬁnite multiplecoexisting ﬁring patterns. These coexisting ﬁring patterns own
attractors having identical topology and boosting along thememristor variable coordinate [ 20,34]. Herein, a mHR neuron
model with our proposed memristor is tamed for simplicity butwithout losing generality. The hidden dynamics and initialcondition-offset boosting behavior of the mHR neuron model are
investigated by numerical simulation and PSIM-based circuit
simulation in this paper. A brief comparison between someaforementioned mHR neuron models and the model reported inthis paper is demonstrated in Table 1 . It is demonstrated that the
memristor employed in building the mHR neuron model in thispaper is different from the memristors reported in theaforementioned literature works. The electromagnetic inductioneffect characterized by the memristor is established by
considering the periodic magnetization processing and non-
uniform distribution of the ions inside and outside the neuronmembrane.
The remainder of this paper is formulated as follows: Section 2
explains the building of a mHR neuron model with hiddendynamics. Section 3 explains memristor parameter- and stimulus
parameter-related dynamical distributions and bifurcationbehaviors by numerical simulations. Section 4 explains the
memristor initial condition-offset boosting behavior and in ﬁnite
multiple coexisting ﬁring patterns. Section 5 explains the analog
circuit design and PSIM-based circuit simulation. Finally, Section 6
brieﬂy concludes the main results of this paper.
2 Memristive Hindmarsh –Rose neuron
model
Considering the periodic magnetization process and non-linear
regulation of electromagnetic induction, a memristor withsinusoidal memductance function and non-linearly modulatedinput is raised, which is mathematically expressed as follows:
i
M/equalsWφ()vM/equalssinφ()vM,
_φ/equalstanh vM(),(1)
where vMand iMrepresent the terminal voltage and current,
respectively. W(φ) = sin( φ) is the periodic memductance
function, and magnetic ﬂuxφis the memristor inner state
variable. Different from the memristor reported in [ 20], this
memristor has a non-linearly modulated input, i.e., ahypertangent function, to re ﬂect the non-uniform distribution of
the ions inside and outside the neuron membrane. The hypertangentfunction is continuously derivable and bounded above and below.
To investigate this kind of electromagnetic induction effect on a
neuron, the memristor is introduced into the existing 2DHindmarsh –Rose neuron model [ 9]; thereby, a 3D mHR neuron
model is built as follows:
_x/equalsy−ax
3+bx2+I+ksinφ()x,
_y/equalsc−dx2−y,
_φ/equalstanh x(),⎧⎪⎨
⎪⎩(2)
where xis the membrane potential and yis the recovery variable. a,
b,c, and dare four controllable parameters in the original model
[39].Iis the externally applied stimulus, and kis the coupling
strength of electromagnetic induction. We mainly consider the
Frontiers in Physics frontiersin.org 02Fan et al. 10.3389/fphy.2023.1160419dynamical effect of the externally applied stimulus Iand coupling
strength kon the mHR neuron model in the following sections.
Therefore, the four controllable parameters, namely, a=1 ,b=3 ,c=
1, and d= 5, are assigned as the original parameters in [ 39,40];Iand
kare adjustable parameters with positive values, and their typical
values are preset to I= 1.5 and k=2 .
By setting the left sides of (2)equal to 0, one can obtain the
following equation:
0/equalsy−x3+3x2+I+ksinφ()x,
0/equals1−5x2−y,
0/equalstanh x().⎧⎪⎨
⎪⎩(3)
Evidently, there is no solution of (3)since Ihas a positive value.
In other words, model (2) has no equilibrium point. Therefore, thedynamical behaviors and ﬁring patterns generated by the 3D mHR
neuron model (2) are hidden [ 41].
3 Parameter-related hidden dynamics
In this section, we mainly focus our concern on the parameter-
related hidden dynamics with the two adjustable parameters of thecoupling strength kand externally applied stimulus I. The initial
conditions [ x(0),y(0),φ(0)] = [0, 0, 0] are utilized. The MATLAB-
based ODE45 algorithm with a ﬁxed time-step duration of 10−2s and
time-end duration of 800 s is utilized to calculate the bifurcationdiagram, and the Jacobi matrix-based Wolf ’s method with a time-
step duration of 0.1 s and time-end duration of 4,000 s is employedto calculate Lyapunov exponent spectra [ 42].
3.1 Dynamical distribution
When the two adjustable parameters kandIare varied in 0.5 ≤
k≤3 and 0 ≤I≤3, dynamical distributions of the bifurcation
diagram and dynamical map in the k–Iparameter plane are
simulated, as shown in Figure 1 . The 2D bifurcation diagram is
depicted by checking the periodicities of the membrane potential x,
as shown in Figure 1A , that is, the trajectories with different
periodicities are painted by different colors. The red marked by
CH represents chaos, and the other colors represent period-1 toperiod-8 marked by P1 to P8, respectively. One can see that the 2Dbifurcation diagram possesses a ribbon structure in some regionsand the ribbons marked by P1, P2, P4, and P8 appear in sequence.TABLE 1 Comparison of relevant papers on the mHR neuron models.

the CH (red) region or near the neighborhood of the CH region.
These declare that numerous periodic windows generated via
tangent bifurcations [ 42] and period-doubling bifurcations [ 29]
are triggered by varying the two parameters. In addition, the 2Ddynamical map described by the largest Lyapunov exponent (LLE) isemployed to depict the parameter-related dynamical distribution inthek–Iparameter plane, as shown in Figure 1B . The colorized
domains are painted with different colors according to the values of
LLE: red for chaos with positive LLE and other colors for a period
with negative LLE.
It is demonstrated that the dynamical behaviors depicted by
dynamical distributions of the 2D bifurcation diagram and 2Ddynamical map are completely identical. These numerical resultsdemonstrate that the coupling strength and externally appliedstimulus can induce abundant dynamical behaviors on neuronproperties of the 3D mHR neuron model.
3.2 Bifurcation behavior
To more clearly demonstrate the bifurcation behaviors with the
coupling strength kand externally applied stimulus I, the one-
dimensional (1D) bifurcation diagram and Lyapunov exponentspectra (LEs) are numerically simulated with the variations of k
andI, as shown in Figures 2A, B , respectively. The representations at
the top of Figures 2A, B display the 1D bifurcation diagrams of the
membrane potential x, while the representations at the bottom
exhibit LEs.
Herein, the externally applied stimulus I=1 . 5i s ﬁxed, and
the coupling strength kis varied in 0.5 ≤k≤3. The 1D

Lyapunov exponent LE 1and partial second Lyapunov
exponent LE 2are shown for better visualization since the
third exponent is very small. The LE 1exponent has a zero

bifurcations. It is observed that the bifurcation behaviors
revealed by the 1D bifurcation diagram (up) are effectivelyveriﬁed by the LEs (bottom) in Figure 2A .
Then, we ﬁx coupling strength k= 2 and change the externally
applied stimulus Iin 0≤I≤3. In Figure 2B , one can see that with the
increase of I, the mHR neuron model undergoes period-1 to chaos
viachaos crisis [ 43], to period-2 viatangent bifurcation, to chaos via
forward period-doubling bifurcations, to period-3 viareverse
period-doubling bifurcations, to chaos viachaos crisis, and ﬁnally
to period-1 viareverse period-doubling bifurcations. It is worth
noting that there exists a small periodic window near theneighborhood of I= 1.95. The LE
1exponent drops to zero and
maintains in the narrow parameter range and then returns to apositive value with the appearance of a periodic window. Obviously,the evolution of LEs con ﬁrms the occurrence of bifurcation
behaviors.
Consequently, these bifurcation behaviors can lead to the
occurrence of abundant periodic ﬁring patterns with different
periodicities and a chaotic ﬁring pattern in the 3D mHR neuron
model and can be regulated by the memristor coupling strength andexternally applied stimulus.
3.3 Hidden ﬁring patterns
In this section, ﬁve values of coupling strength kwith I= 1.5 are
selected from Figure 2A to partially display the ﬁring patterns
emerged from the 3D mHR neuron model, as shown in Figure 3 .

corresponding phase portraits in the φ–xphase plane (right) are
demonstrated; they are period-1 spiking, period-2 spiking, period-4spiking, period-8 spiking, and chaotic spiking for k= 1, 1.5, 1.6, 1.65,
and 2, respectively. These numerical results further demonstrate that
the 3D mHR neuron model can generate hidden ﬁring patterns of
periodic spiking behaviors with different periodicities and a chaoticspiking behavior. Moreover, the state transition (P1-P2-P4-P8-CH)ofﬁring patterns con ﬁrms the generation of the period-doubling
bifurcation route.
4 Initial condition-related dynamics
Of particular interest, the 3D mHR neuron model (2) can show
the initial condition-offset boosting behavior since the involvementof sinusoidal memductance function [ 20,44]. This can triggerinﬁnite multiple coexisting ﬁring patterns for a ﬁxed set of model
parameters. In this section, we mainly focus our attention on thisissue. Herein, we only consider the memristor initial condition-induced dynamical effect and set the initial conditions as [ x(0),y(0),
φ(0)] = [0, 0, φ(0)]. The numerical simulation settings are identical
with those employed in Section 3 .
4.1 Initial condition-offset boosting
Herein, two sets of model parameters, i.e., I= 1.5, k= 1.5 and I=
1.5,k= 2, are selected as paradigms to demonstrate the memristor
initial condition-offset boosting behavior. The memristor initial
condition is adjusted in the region [ –20, 20]. The bifurcation
plots of the 1D bifurcation diagram and Lyapunov exponentspectra for the two sets of model parameters are shown inFigures 4A, B , respectively.

spiking), respectively.
Frontiers in Physics frontiersin.org 05Fan et al. 10.3389/fphy.2023.1160419Figure 4A shows the bifurcation plots for I= 1.5 and k= 1.5,
which demonstrates period-2 spiking ﬁring patterns with the
increase of the initial condition φ(0). One can see that the
locations of these ﬁring patterns possess a step-by-step structure
and their dynamic amplitude is identical. In addition, the memristor
initial condition applies at 2 πinitial condition-offset, which is the
period of the sinusoidal memductance function sin( φ). In this case,
the step change happens periodically. In addition, the LE 1and LE 2
exponents demonstrate constant Lyapunov exponent spectra andare not related to the memristor initial condition, i.e., LE
1= 0 and
LE2=−0.15.
As shown in Figure 4B , the bifurcation plots for I= 1.5 and k=
2 are elaborated. The results also display the step-by-step memristor
initial condition-offset boosting behavior; thereby, multiple
coexisting chaotic ﬁring patterns are generated. Also, the
memristor initial condition applies at 2 πinitial condition-offset,
and these steps periodically occur. Identically, the Lyapunovexponent spectra display constant values of LE
1and LE 2and
possess LE 1= 0.21 and LE 2= 0 for the chaotic ﬁring patterns. It
is worth noting that the initial condition-offset boosting behaviorexists for other ﬁring patterns under different ﬁxed model
parameters. In addition, the memristor initial condition-offsetboosting behavior can trigger in ﬁnite multiple coexisting ﬁring
patterns. We only demonstrate this behavior in a ﬁnite range of
memristor initial conditions in this study.
4.2 In ﬁnite multiple coexisting ﬁring patterns
In the previous bifurcation analysis for the memristor initial
condition-offset boosting behavior, the results display theoccurrence of hidden in ﬁnite multiple coexisting ﬁring patterns
in the 3D mHR neuron model. To further demonstrate this striking
memristor initial condition-offset boosting behavior, the coexisting
ﬁring patterns are displayed by the phase portrait in the φ–xphase
plane, as shown in Figure 5 . The coexisting period-2 spiking ﬁring
patterns for I= 1.5 and k= 1.5 under the initial conditions φ(0)
=−18,−12,−6, 0, 6, 12, and 18 are shown in Figure 5A . These initial
conditions are selected in each step from the bifurcation diagram inFigure 4A . The offsets among each of the two adjacent attractors of

Frontiers in Physics frontiersin.org 06Fan et al. 10.3389/fphy.2023.1160419ﬁring patterns are all 2 π, and these attractors are not connected,
which implies the emergence of initial condition-offset boostedattractors. The attractors possess identical topology but differentlocations. Similarly, the memristor initial condition-offset boostedcoexisting chaotic ﬁring patterns for I= 1.5 and k= 2 under the
initial conditions φ(0)=−18,−12,−6, 0, 6, 12, and 18 are also
demonstrated in Figure 5B . It is worth noting that we do not select
the initial conditions with the interval 2 πfor their convenient setting
in PSIM-based circuit simulation. These results demonstrate the
generation of hidden in ﬁnite multiple coexisting ﬁring patterns in
our proposed 3D mHR neuron model.
5 Analog design and PSIM-based circuit
simulation
The analog circuit design of neuron models is crucial for
investigating the neuron dynamics and exploring neuron-basedengineering applications [ 45,46]. The 3D mHR neuron model
can be easily designed by utilizing passive circuit components ofa capacitor and resistor and the integrated chips of operationalampli ﬁer, multiplier, and trigonometric circuit modules. The circuit
schematic representation is well-designed and given in Figure 6 . The
memristor equivalent circuit contains a hypertangent circuit module
[47], a sinusoidal function chip U
5, an operational ampli ﬁerU4,a
multiplier M3, a capacitor, and two resistors, as shown in the bottom
part of Figure 6 . The main circuit involves two integrators, two
multipliers, and an inverter, as shown in the top part of Figure 6 .
Then, the circuit state equations can be correspondingly built asfollows:

where v
x,vy, and vφare three circuit state variables corresponding to
the model variables x,y, and φ, respectively. We suppose C1=C2=
C3=Cand the integral time constant RC= 1 ms, i.e., C= 100 nF and
R=1 0 k Ω. In addition, the recovery variable vyis linearly
transformed to reduce its dynamic amplitude as follows:
vx,vy,vφ () /equalsvx,10vy,vφ () .( 5 )
The linear transformation is conducive to a hardware
experiment since the value of the recovery variable approachesthe saturation voltage of operational ampli ﬁers without
transformation. Thereby, the other circuit parameters arecalculated as R
1=1 0 k Ω,R2=1 kΩ,R3= 3.3 k Ω,R4=1 0 k Ω,
R5=1 0k Ω,R6=2 0k Ω,R7= 100 k Ω,R8=1 0k Ω,R9= 3.3 k Ω,g1=
g2=g3=1V−1, and Vc= 1 V by comparing (2)with (4). It is worth
noting that the two adjustable parameters can be regulated by I=VI
andk=R/R9. The initial states of three capacitors are assigned as
[vx(0),vy(0),vφ(0)] = [0 V, 0 V, vφ(0)].
Employing the circuit schematic representation illustrated in
Figure 6 , a PSIM-based simulation circuit is built and circuit

Frontiers in Physics frontiersin.org 07Fan et al. 10.3389/fphy.2023.1160419parameters are accurately set. First, the two adjustable circuit
parameters are set to VI= 1.5 V and R9= 6.667 k Ω
corresponding to I= 1.5 and k= 1.5. By respectively setting the
memristor initial condition vφ(0) to −18 V, −12 V, −6 V, 0 V, 6 V,
12 V, and 18 V, PSIM-based circuit simulations are executed andphase trajectories are obtained in the v
φ–vxphase plane, as shown in
Figure 7A . Then, the two adjustable circuit parameters are set to VI=
1.5 V and R9=5kΩcorresponding to I= 1.5 and k= 2. The PSIM-
based circuit simulations are illustrated in Figure 7B . One can see
that the PSIM-based circuit simulations in Figure 7 are very
consistent with the numerical results in Figure 5 . These circuit-
simulated results manifest the occurrence of hidden in ﬁnite multiple
coexisting initial condition-offset boosting ﬁring patterns in our
proposed 3D mHR neuron model. It is worth noting that the power
supplies for operational ampli ﬁers and multipliers are, respectively,
set to ±30 V and ±15 V in PSIM-based circuit simulation.
6 Conclusion
In this paper, an ideal ﬂux-controlled memristor with sinusoidal
memductance and non-linearly modulated input was presented to
depict the electromagnetic induction effect in biological neurons.
Then, the electromagnetic induction effect on an existing 2DHindmarsh –Rose neuron model was elaborated. Theoretical
analysis and numerical simulation demonstrated that the 3DmHR neuron model can generate the hidden memristor initialcondition-offset boosting behavior with in ﬁnite multiple
coexisting ﬁring patterns. The attractors of these ﬁring patterns
have an offset along the memristor variable coordinate, and the
offset is identical with the period of memductance function. In
addition, PSIM-based circuit simulation further con ﬁrmed the
validation of the analog circuit design and generation of theinitial condition-offset boosting behavior. It is worth noting thatthe power supplies should be suitably set in PSIM-based circuitsimulation to capture the offset boosting ﬁring patterns. The settings
can refer to the dynamic range for the attractors of these ﬁring
patterns along with the memristor variable coordinate. This hinders
the hardware experimental measurement of initial condition-offset
boosting ﬁring patterns. In addition, it is not easy to accurately set
the initial conditions in each step to acquire corresponding ﬁring
patterns from hardware experiments. However, the memristorinitial condition-offset boosting ﬁring patterns have potentiality
in neuron-based engineering applications [ 37,48], i.e., thewaveform bias of chaotic signal and random signal generation
[49]. These deserve our future concern.
