A tartan pattern in fabric is defined by its check or plaid design in a variety of colors, where bands of color are repeated in equal proportion in both the warp (running lengthwise) and weft (running across) of the woven fabric. Each stripe in the warp crosses every stripe in the weft, creating a solid color at the points of intersection. The arrangement of colored threads is the same in both the warp and the weft, making the pattern symmetrical and distinctive.
