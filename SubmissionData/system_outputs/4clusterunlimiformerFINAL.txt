  The benefit of FLARE over existing retrieval augmented LMs is that it anticipates the future by generating a temporary next sentence and using it as a query to retrieve relevant documents, rather than relying on the current context. This allows FLARE to retrieve information that is relevant to future generations, rather than just the current one. Additionally, FLARE interleaves generation and retrieval, which increases both overheads and the cost of generation, but also provides significant gains in terms of retrieval performance.

The author identifies three main reasons for this superior performance:1. Different input representation for predicting the next tokens: kNN-LM uses a different input representation than standard LMs, which allows it to better capture the context and structure of the input sequence.2. Approximate kNN search: kNN-LM uses an approximate k-nearest neighbor search algorithm, which is faster and more efficient than the exact search algorithm used in standard LMs.3. Importance of softmax temperature for the kNN distribution: The softmax temperature parameter in kNN-LM affects the distribution of the k-nearest neighbors, which can help the model to better handle out-of-vocab

  According to the OUTDOOR paper, robots should ideally exist in outdoor environments where they can strategically predict information in space to effectively navigate and reason. While indoor environments have been the focus of recent advancements in Object Goal Navigation, the broader spectrum of real-world robotic applications often extends to outdoor settings. Localization systems are crucial for any autonomous robot, particularly in urban canyons where GNSSs deteriorate in accuracy and reliability. Therefore, intelligent agents must be capable of predicting information in space to navigate and reason within more complex outdoor contexts.
