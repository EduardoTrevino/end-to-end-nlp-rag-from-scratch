These transformations may include delimiting words by spaces, glossing each token in the text with a brief explanation, and aligning words across languages. SenteCon also provides a way to subdivide long segments into smaller ones using subtitling guidelines, which can help improve downstream evaluation metrics. However, it is important to note that the tool does not provide a complete solution for all language pairs and may require additional context or manual effort to achieve accurate translations in some cases.
