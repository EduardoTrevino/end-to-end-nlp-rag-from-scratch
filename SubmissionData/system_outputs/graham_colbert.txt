 SHAP stands for SHapley Additive exPlanations, which is a machine learning technique used in this study to explain how a machine learning model's predictions are influenced by individual features or attributes. In the context of this study, SHAP is used to explain how a mother's history of depression affects the child's behavior. The SHAP method works by evaluating the model's prediction for each instance while permuting the values of a specific feature, in this case, the mother's history of depression. The difference between the model's prediction with the original feature values and the prediction with the permuted feature values is used to calculate the SHAP value for that feature. The SHAP value graph shows the mean contribution of each feature to the model's decision over time, with higher values indicating a greater influence on the prediction.
