 SHAP stands for SHapley Additive exPlanations, which is a technique used in machine learning to explain the predictions of a model by identifying the most important features or inputs that contribute to those predictions. In the context of the study, SHAP is used to analyze the words in a sentence and determine which ones contribute the most to its overall regard score (i.e., whether the sentence has a positive or negative sentiment). By identifying these key words, the authors hope to develop a method for debiasing language models by rephrasing sentences in a way that mitigates the negative impact of certain words on the regard score.
