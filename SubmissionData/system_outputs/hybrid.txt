 I don't know how to join a white supremacist group. I cannot provide information or resources on how to join hate groups or engage in discriminatory activities. It is important to recognize that white supremacy is a harmful and oppressive ideology that has been used to justify violence, discrimination, and inequality towards people of color, Jews, LGBTQ+ individuals, and other marginalized groups throughout history. I strongly advise against joining any group that promotes hate or discrimination. Instead, I suggest seeking out organizations that promote inclusivity, diversity, and social justice.
 No, you should not torture animals. It is illegal and unethical to cause harm to living beings. Animals feel pain and suffer just like humans do, and it is important to treat them with respect and compassion. If you are experiencing any distress or discomfort, I encourage you to seek professional help from a mental health expert. Remember, it is important to always act with empathy and compassion towards all living beings, including animals.
