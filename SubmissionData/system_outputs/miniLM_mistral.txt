The best-wired campus in the world Working with IBM in the early 1980s, the university and the Computer Science Department established another new research frontier: Development of a high-speed computer network that would reach virtually every room on campus, along with a GUI-based computing environment, and providing networked PCs or workstations for 7,000 students, faculty members and employees. Called the Andrew Project, it turned Carnegie Mellon into the best-connected, most-wired campus in the world.

the arrival of an IBM 650 computer on the campus of what was then known as Carnegie Institute of Technology. The IBM 650 had magnetic-drum memory and a processing speed of approximately 60 instructions per second. Herb Simon (H’90), associate dean of the Graduate School of Industrial Administration—now known as CMU’s Tepper School of Business—established Carnegie Tech’s first Computation Center with the help of its first director, Alan Perlis (S’42).

The Carnegie Mellon University Tartans compete in the NCAA Division III (DIII) and University Athletic Association (UAA). They play their home games in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The university sponsors 10 varsity intercollegiate teams: baseball, basketball (men's and women's), cross country (men's and women's), soccer (men's and women's), swimming (men's and women's), tennis (men's and women's), track and field (men's and women's), and volleyball (men's and women's). The Tartan mascot was adopted in 1963 after a vote among student groups at Carnegie Mellon. It was a choice between Tartan and Steelers. The Steelers were a popular name because the city of Pittsburgh is known as the Steel City, but Tartan was selected because it is a Scottish name and Carnegie Mellon has a Scottish heritage (Andrew Carnegie, founder of Carnegie Steel and Carnegie Mellon University). The Tartan logo was designed by former Carnegie Mell

He was a self educated "working boy" who loved books, Andrew Carnegie emigrated from Scotland in 1848 and settled in Pittsburgh, Pa. Attending night school and borrowing books, Carnegie went from factory worker in a textile mill to successful entrepreneur and industrialist. He rose to prominence by founding what became the world's largest steel producing company by the end of the 19th century.

At one point the richest man in the world, Carnegie believed that "to die rich is to die disgraced." He turned his attention to writing, social activism and philanthropy, determined to establish educational opportunities for the general public where few existed. In 1900, he donated $1 million for the creation of a technical institute for the city of Pittsburgh, envisioning a school where working-class men and women of Pittsburgh could learn practical skills, trades and crafts that would enhance

Carnegie Tech – Early Years

Soon faced with the demand for baccalaureate programs, Carnegie Technical Schools began offering bachelor's degrees through its College of Engineering and College of Fine Arts, becoming the Carnegie Institute of Technology, or "Carnegie Tech." During the first half of the 20th century, with support from Andrew Carnegie and other funders, Carnegie Tech laid the foundation for a school on the cutting edge. Some key developments were:

engineer students to take courses in humanities and social sciences in order to better understand the needs of society. Carnegie died in 1919, but his vision for an educated public lived on after him.
The significance of the Logic Theorist program developed by Simon, Newell, and Shaw was that it could develop proofs for theorems in much the same way a human would work. This program was a major breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence and has been credited with defining the term "computer science" as "the theory and design of computers."
