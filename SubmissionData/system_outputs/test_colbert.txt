 To apply for the Dual-Degree Ph.D. program at LTI, students must apply through Carnegie Mellon's online application portal. Additionally, students must contact Stacey Young when applying. The application deadline is typically in December for fall admission. Students must provide all supporting documentation by the application deadline, or their application will be considered incomplete and cannot be reviewed. The program does not allow direct transfers from its master’s programs into its Ph.D. program, but students who are already enrolled in an LTI degree program may not be required to retake GRE or TOEFL exams or produce new transcripts. Finally, courses that satisfy LTI Ph.D. degree requirements may also be used to satisfy requirements for one M.S. degree.
