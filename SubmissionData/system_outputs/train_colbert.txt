 CMU's approach to computer science education and research evolved significantly from the 1950s to the 2010s, with a focus on interdisciplinary research and collaboration. In the 1950s, CMU established a computer science department, which became a model for other universities.

In 1988, CMU's Faculty Senate approved a plan to elevate the Department of Computer Science to a college within the university, resulting in the formation of the School of Computer Science in 1989. Throughout its history, CMU has been at the forefront of computer science education and research, with a focus on innovation and collaboration.

 The LTI Dual-Degree Ph.D. program differs from traditional Ph.D. programs in terms of structure and focus as it allows students to earn both a Master's degree in Language Technologies (MLT) or Master's degree in Computer Science (MSCS) while working towards their Ph.D. degree. Additionally, LTI students can use courses taken as a master's degree student towards their Ph.D. program requirements, but cannot use those same courses towards any other master's degree offered by the school. However, LTI students who have passed the requirements for an LTI Master's degree can receive the master's degree without any additional work. Unlike traditional Ph.D. programs, LTI does not allow direct transfers from its master's programs into its Ph.D. program, and students must apply for the Ph.D. program at the usual time. However, LTI students who are already enrolled in an LTI degree program are not required to retake GRE and TOEFL exams or produce new transcripts from other universities.
