Abstract
Automata networks, and in particular Boolean networks, are used to model diverse networks of
interactingentities. Theinteractiongraphofanautomatanetwor kisits mostimportantparameter,
as it represents the overall architecture of the network. A cont inuous amount of work has been
devoted to infer dynamical properties of the automata network b ased on its interaction graph
only. Robert’s theorem is the seminal result in this area; it states th at automata networks with
an acyclic interaction graph converge to a unique ﬁxed point. The fe edback bound can be viewed
as an extension of Robert’s theorem; it gives an upper bound on the number of ﬁxed points of an
automata network based on the size of a minimum feedback vertex s et of its interaction graph.
Boolean networks can be viewed as self-mappings on the power set la ttice of the set of entities.
In this paper, we consider self-mappings on a general complete latt ice. We make two conceptual
contributions. Firstly, we can view a digraph as a residuated mapping on the power set lattice; as
such, we deﬁne a graph on a complete lattice as a residuated mapping on that lattice. We extend
and generalise some results on digraphs to our setting. Secondly, w e introduce a generalised notion
of dependency whereby any mapping φcan depend on any other mapping α. In fact, we are able
to give four kinds of dependency in this case. We can then vastly exp and Robert’s theorem to
self-mappings on general complete lattices; we similarly generalise th e feedback bound. We then
obtain stronger results in the case where the lattice is a complete Bo olean algebra. We ﬁnally show
how our results can be applied to prove the convergence of automa ta networks.
1 Introduction
1.1 Automata networks and Robert’s theorem
Automata networks are used to represent diﬀerent networks of interacting entities, such as neural
networks, gene regulatory networks, or social interaction s (see [14] and references therein). In such
networks, each entity i∈Vhas a state xitaking its values in some alphabet. Usually, this alphabet
Qis ﬁnite and is the same for all entities, so that the overall c onﬁguration of the network is x∈QV;
ifQ={0,1}, this is called a Boolean network. The value of xithen evolves over time according to
a deterministic function φi, which depends on the state of several entities in the networ k. As such,
the whole network is formalised as a mapping φ:QV→QVwhich represents the evolution of the
conﬁguration over time.
A main problem in the theory of automata networks is to infer p roperties on the dynamics of the
conﬁguration xbased only on partial knowledge of the mapping φ. Amongst the numerous dynamical
properties of interest, such as the number of periodic point s ofφor its transient length, the number
of ﬁxed points of φis the most thoroughly studied. In terms of partial knowledg e ofφ, the interaction
graph of an automata network represents the overall archite cture of the network, where each arc
represents the inﬂuence of an entity on another. Formally, i t is a digraph D= (V,E) where (i,j) is
an arc whenever φjdepends essentially on xi, i.e.
∃a,b∈QV:ak=bk∀k̸=i,φj(a)̸=φj(b). (1)

1A continuous amount of work has been devoted to infer dynamic al properties based on the interaction
graph only (see [10] for a review). We shall focus on two main r esults on the number of ﬁxed points.
Firstly, Robert’s theorem [28, 29] is the seminal result in t he study of automata networks. It states
that automata networks with an acyclic interaction graph co nverge to a unique ﬁxed point. Secondly,
the feedback bound [27, 1] can be viewed as an extension of Rob ert’s theorem as it gives an upper
bound on the number of ﬁxed points of an automata network base d on the size of a minimum feedback
vertex set of its interaction graph.
1.2 Robert’s theorem, paradoxes and hypodoxes
On top of their applications, automata networks have also be en used in theoretical work, such as
network coding [27, 26, 15, 13], hat games [12, 9], or logic. L et us brieﬂy explain the connection to
logic, as it was used to expand on Robert’s theorem to the case of inﬁnite Boolean networks; the
details can be found in [20].
The basic idea is to identify any set of propositional senten ces with a Boolean network, where
Q={0,1}andxiis the truth value of sentence ifor alli. A valid truth assignment to these sentences
then corresponds to a ﬁxed point of the Boolean network. Thus , a Boolean with no ﬁxed points
is a paradox, while a Boolean network with multiple ﬁxed poin ts corresponds to a hypodox. The
interaction graph of the Boolean network represents how the sentences refer to one another; a cycle in
the interaction graph is then a case of self-reference. Thus , Robert’s theorem implies that a paradox
or a hypodox involving a ﬁnite number of sentences must use se lf-reference.
For instance, consider the well-known paradox:
The next sentence is true.
The previous sentence is false.
This can be viewed as a Boolean network with two variables x1,x2∈ {0,1}describing the truth value
of each sentence, and two Boolean functions φ1(x) =x2,φ2(x) =¬x1expressing the actual sentences.
The interaction graph of this Boolean network is simply a cyc le of length two. Since this Boolean
network has no ﬁxed points, this is a paradox. Similarly, con sider this hypodox:
The next sentence is true.
The previous sentence is true.
This can be viewed as a Boolean network with two variables x1,x2∈ {0,1}, and two Boolean functions
φ1(x) =x2,φ2(x) =x1. Again, its interaction graph is a cycle of length two. It has two ﬁxed points,
namelyx= 11 (both sentences are true) and x= 00 (both sentences are false).
However, the situation is diﬀerent when considering inﬁnite Boolean networks. Yablo [30] discov-
ered his famous paradox without self-reference with a sente nce for each natural number:
Sentencei: “For allj >i, Sentencejis false.”
In our terminology, this corresponds to the Boolean network with update function φi(x) =⋀
j>i¬xj
for everyi∈N. This Boolean network has no ﬁxed points, and hence it is a par adox, even though
its interaction graph is acyclic. Another diﬀerence with the ﬁnite case is the deﬁnition of dependency.
Take this simple Boolean network as an example: ω:{0,1}N→ {0,1}Nwhereωi(x) = 1 if and only if
xhas inﬁnite support for all i∈N. According to Equation (1), the interaction graph of ωis empty:
changing the value of a single variable does not aﬀect the ﬁnit eness of the overall support. Rabern,
Rabern and Macauley [20] use a workaround to the interaction graph issue, whereby a function is
independent of a set of variables; this shall be reviewed in t he sequel. They then prove that non-self-
referential paradoxes must contain an inﬁnite number of sen tences that involve an inﬁnite number of
variables. They also fully classify the graphs that allow hy podoxes.
1.3 Contributions and outline
Inthispaper, weexpandRobert’stheorem andthefeedback bo undto even widerdomainsthaninﬁnite
Boolean networks. We view a conﬁguration as x∈L, and we consider self-mappings φ:L→L, where
2L= (L,∨,∧,0,1) is a complete lattice. Boolean networks then reduce to the c ase where Lis the
lattice of subsets P(V). Robert’s theorem asserts that a ﬁnite automata network wi th an acyclic
interaction graph converges to a single ﬁxed point. Accordi ngly, we generalise the concepts of graph,
interaction graph (via the notion of dependency), acyclic g raph, and we obtain diﬀerent convergence
results. We give a summary of our contributions leading to th e generalised Robert’s theorem below;
we simplify some technical terms which will be fully explain ed in the following sections of the paper.
•Firstly, we generalise the concept of graph to any complete l attice. A digraph Dnaturally
induces a mappingon P(V), wherebyf(x) =ND(x) is the in-neighbourhood of x. This mapping
preserves arbitrary unions, i.e. f(⋃
x∈Sx) =⋃
x∈Sf(x); equivalently, fis a residuated mapping
[6], and in fact all residuated self-mappings of P(V) are of this form. In our general setting, we
then deﬁne a graph as any residuated mapping on L. In Section 3, we investigate the properties
of graphs on lattices and we generalise some well known resul ts on digraphs to our setting,
such as the topological sort of acyclic graphs or the ﬁnite to pology theorem. This solidiﬁes our
intuition that this is an appropriate way to generalise grap hs.
•Secondly, we widely generalise the notion of dependency giv en in [20] into four kinds of depen-
dency. One crucial aspect is that a mapping φcan depend on any other mapping α:L→L,
even ifαis not a graph. Those four kinds of dependency are related to e ach other but they yield
slightly diﬀerent results.
•Thirdly, we generalise the notion of ﬁnite acyclic graph in s everal ways. In [20], it is proved
that the graphs on which hypodoxes depend are exactly the dig raphs without inﬁnite walks. As
such, we ﬁrst introduce the notion of a ﬁxed point-free graph in Section 3.4, which generalises
such digraphs to all complete lattices. However, this notio n is not strong enough to generalise
Robert’s theorem, and hence we also introduce asymptotical ly meet-nilpotent graphs in Section
3.5, which will be appropriate when the lattice is a complete Boolean algebra. In general,
Robert’s theorem can be viewed as a consequence of the Banach contraction principle, where
the interaction graph of φinduces a metric for which the mapping φis contractive. Therefore, in
Section 4.2, we introduce so-called covering/metric/comp lete mappings α, which allow to deﬁne
a metric of varying strength for which the mapping φshall be contractive.
•Fourthly, we then prove a generalisation of Robert’s theore m in Theorem 4.3.1. In fact, there
are four versions, one for each kind of dependency, and each v ersion gives three levels, depending
on the properties of the mapping αon whichφdepends (e.g. metric or complete). One version
can be informally summarised as: if φdepends on the complete mapping α, thenφconverges
to a unique ﬁxed point e. An interesting feature of Theorem 4.3.1 is that it gives an a ctual
formula for the unique ﬁxed point e. In Theorem 4.5.1, we then generalise the feedback bound
to mappings over complete lattices; this is based on metric m appings.
We then focus on the case where the lattice Lis a complete Boolean algebra. We ﬁrst introduce
the transpose of a graph, which generalises the notion of rev ersing the direction of every arc in a
digraph. The generalised Robert’s theorem simpliﬁes great ly whenφdepends on a graph over a
complete Boolean algebra. In that case, all four kinds of dep endency are equivalent, and a graph is
covering/metric/complete if and only if its transpose is as ymptotically meet-nilpotent. As such, we
obtain a stronger (and more succinct) Robert’s theorem for c omplete Boolean algebras in Theorem
5.3.2. Fixed point-free graphs play a crucial role here: bas ed on them we strengthen the classiﬁcation
of graphs of hypodoxes in [20] and generalise it to all comple te Boolean algebras, and the feedback
bound for complete Boolean algebras depends on ﬁxed point-f ree graphs instead of metric mappings.
Our results are generalisations of the original Robert’s th eorem. Even though most of our work is
devoted to inﬁnite lattices, wherenontrivial problems of c onvergence arise, our results can also beused
to infer the convergence of ﬁnite automata networks. In fact , we show a converse of Robert’s theorem
in the ﬁnite case: any mapping φthat converges to a single ﬁxed point depends on a nilpotent g raph.
We also highlight some concrete examples of mappings whose c onvergence can be proved using our
generalised Robert’s theorem but which fail to satisfy the h ypothesis of the original Robert’s theorem.
3The rest of the paper is organised as follows. In Section 2, we review some useful concepts about
the Banach contraction principle, Robert’s theorem, and co mplete lattices. In Section 3, we introduce
graphs as residuated mappings on complete lattices and gene ralise some graph-theoretic results to
this case. We then focus on ﬁxed point-free and asymptotical ly meet-nilpotent graphs. Section 4 then
deals with Robert’s theorem for complete lattices. We ﬁrst i ntroduce the four kinds of dependency in
Section 4.1 and covering/metric/complete mappings in Sect ion 4.2. We then give Robert’s theorem for
complete lattices in Section 4.3 and discuss its tightness i n Section 4.4. We ﬁnally give the generalised
feedback boundinSection 4.5. Section 5isthendedicated to Robert’stheoremandthefeedbackbound
for complete Boolean algebras. We provide some application s of our results to automata networks in
Section 6 and conclude the paper in Section 7.
2 Preliminaries
2.1 Contraction principles
We denote the set of natural numbers as N={0,1,2,...}and for all j∈N, we denote Nj={i∈N:
i≥j}. LetXbe a set and φ:X→X. We consider the following sets of points of Xwith respect to
φ.
(a) A point x∈Xis aﬁxed point ofφifφ(x) =x. The set of ﬁxed points of φis denoted by
Fix(φ).
(b) A point x∈Xis aparabolic point ofφif there exists a sequence ( xi:i∈N) withx0=xand
φ(xi) =xi−1for alli≥1. The set of parabolic points of φis denoted by Par( φ).
(c) A point x∈Xis apyramidal point ofφif there exists a sequence ( xi:i∈N) withφi(xi) =x
for alli≥1. The set of pyramidal points of φis denoted by Pyr( φ). We then have
Pyr(φ) =⋂
i∈Nφi(X).
We then have
Fix(φ)⊆Par(φ)⊆Pyr(φ).
Those special points are illustrated in Figure 1.
It is readily seen that φ(Fix(φ)) = Fix(φ). The same holds for the set of parabolic points, as seen
below.
Lemma 2.1.1. For anyφ:X→X, we haveφ(Par(φ)) = Par(φ).
Proof.We ﬁrst prove that φ(Par(φ))⊆Par(φ). Lety∈φ(Par(φ)), i.e.y=φ(x) withx0=xand
φ(xi) =xi−1for alli≥1. Deﬁney0=yandyi=xi−1for alli≥1, thenφ(yi) =yi−1for alli≥1;
this shows that y∈Par(φ).
Conversely, we now prove that Par( φ)⊆φ(Par(φ)). Ifx∈Par(φ) withx0=xandφ(xi) =xi−1
for alli≥1, then letz=x1. Deﬁnez0=zandzi=xi+1for alli≥1, thenφ(zi) =zi−1for alli≥1,
hencez∈Par(φ) andx=φ(z)∈φ(Par(φ)).
We haveφ(Pyr(φ))⊆Pyr(φ) for allφ, but we do not necessarily have the reverse containment, as
we shall see in Example 3.5.4.
We can now express three contraction prinicples. Let ( X,d) be a metric space and φ:X→X.
All limits shall be taken with respect to d. For anyc<1,φisc-contractive if d(φ(x),φ(y))≤cd(x,y),
andφiscontractive if it isc-contractive for some c <1. Also,φconverges toe∈Xif for all
x∈X, limn→∞φn(x) =e, which we denote by φ→e. Clearly, if a contractive mapping φconverges
toe, then Fix(φ) ={e}. The Banach contraction principle [17, Chapter 1, Theorem 1 .1] asserts that a
contractive mapping on a complete metric space converges to a unique ﬁxed point – to contrast with
our next result, we shall refer to it as the complete Banach co ntraction principle.

Theorem 2.1.2 (Complete Banach contraction principle) .Let(X,d)be a complete metric space, and
letφ:X→Xbe contractive. Then there exists e∈Xsuch that Fix(φ) ={e}, andφ→e.
The complete Banach contraction principle does not assert a nything about the parabolic points of
φ. Indeed, if X=Rendowed with the usual metric d(x,y) =|x−y|, then the mapping φ:x↦→x
2is
contractive, but all real numbers are parabolic points (wit hxi= 2ixfor alli∈N).
We sayφstrongly converges toe∈Xifφconverges to eand Pyr(φ) = Fix(φ) ={e}, and we
denote it by φ։e. A metric space ( X,d) isbounded if there exists Msuch thatd(x,y)≤Mfor
allx,y∈X. The bounded Banach contraction principle [19] shows that i fφhas a pyramidal point,
then it strongly converges to it.
Theorem 2.1.3 (Bounded Banach contraction principle) .Let(X,d)be a bounded metric space, and
letφ:X→Xbe contractive. Then there exists e∈Xsuch that Pyr(φ) = Fix(φ)⊆ {e}, and if
Fix(φ) ={e}, thenφ։e.
Combining the previous two contraction principles, we obta in the following corollary.
Corollary 2.1.4 (Complete boundedBanach contraction principle) .Let(X,d)be a complete bounded
metric space, and let φ:X→Xbe contractive. Then there exists e∈Xsuch that Pyr(φ) = Fix(φ) =
{e}, andφ։e.
2.2 Robert’s theorem for ﬁnite automata networks
LetXbe a Cartesian product of sets indexed by a set V, i.e.X=∏
v∈VXv. We shall introduce
shorthand notations for any subset IofV, e.g.XI=∏
i∈IXi,xI= (xi:i∈I), etc. Then an
automata network is a mapping φ:X→X; aﬁnite automata network is an automata network
whereVis ﬁnite; a Boolean network is an automata network where |Xv|= 2 for allv∈V. We can
decompose any automata network φ:X→Xas a family φ= (φv:X→Xv), whereφ(x)v=φv(x)
for allx∈X.
Adigraph is a pairD= (V,E) whereE⊆V2. We shall identify the digraph Dwith its in-
neighbourhood function: for any set I⊆Vof vertices, its in-neighbourhood in Dis
D(I) ={u:∃v∈I,(u,v)∈E}.
5LetD= (V,E) be a digraph. Adapting [22, Deﬁnition 24], we say that φ:X→Xdepends onDif
for allx,y∈XandS⊆V,
xD(S)=yD(S)=⇒φS(x) =φS(y).
It is worth noting that when we write “ φdepends on D”, we eﬀectively mean that the local function
φiofφonly depends on the variables xjin the in-neighbourhood of i. In fact, [22] say that φ
is “independent” of all the other variables. For this notion of dependency, and its generalisations
introduced in Section 4.1, one should always have this inter pretation of “ φdepending on nothing more
thanD” in mind.
The mapping φj:X→Xjdepends essentially onxiif changing the value of xican change
the value of φj(x); more formally, if and only if there exist a,b∈Xsuch thataV\i=bV\iand
φj(a)̸=φj(b). Theinteraction graph ofφis the digraph Gφ= (V,E) with (i,j)∈Eif and only if
φjdepends essentially on i. IfVis ﬁnite, then φdepends on Dif and only if Gφ⊆D.
Robert’s theorem states that if φis a ﬁnite automata network with an acyclic interaction grap h,
thenφconverges to a unique ﬁxed point (in at most |V|steps). Below we give two proofs: the ﬁrst
one is based on a “crystallisation” phenomenon, which prove s convergence in a ﬁnite number of steps;
while the second is based on the complete bounded Banach cont raction principle, which we will be
able to generalise.
Theorem 2.2.1 (Robert’s theorem for ﬁnite automata networks [28]) .Letφbe a ﬁnite automata
network. If the interaction graph of φis acyclic, then φstrongly converges to a unique ﬁxed point.
Proof.Let|V|=n, and order the vertices of Gφso that (i,j) is an arc only if i<j. LetS0=∅and
Si={1,...,i}for 1≤i≤n. We then have Gφ(Si)⊆Si−1, thus for any x,y∈X,
xSi−1=ySi−1=⇒xGφ(Si)=yGφ(Si)=⇒φSi(x) =φSi(y).
First proof: Since xS0=yS0for allx,y, we obtain by simple induction φi
Si(x) =φi
Si(y) and hence
φn(x) =φn(y).
Second proof: Alternatively, let ∆( x,y) ={0≤i≤n:xSi̸=ySi}andd(x,y) =∑
i∈∆(x,y)2−i.
Then (L,d) forms a complete bounded metric space. Since d(φ(x),φ(y))≤1
2d(x,y),φis contractive
and hence by the complete bounded Banach contraction princi ple it strongly converges to a unique
ﬁxed point.
The feedback bound is a result closely related to Robert’s th eorem. Let Dbe a ﬁnite digraph.
Afeedback vertex set ofDis a setI⊆Vsuch thatD[V\I] is acyclic. Anticipating notation
introduced in the next section in more generality, deﬁne D+(S) ={v∈V:D(v)⊆S}for allS⊆V.
ThenIis a feedback vertex set of Dif and only if D+n(I) =V, wheren=|V|, see [8].
Theorem 2.2.2 (Feedback bound for ﬁnite automata networks [27, 1]) .Letφbe a ﬁnite automata
network and let Ibe a feedback vertex set of its interaction graph. Then |Fix(φ)| ≤ |XI|.
Proof.LetG=Gφbe the interaction graph of φand suppose a,b∈Fix(φ) satisfyaI=bI. Then it is
easily shown by induction that aG+i(I)=bG+i(I)for all 0≤i≤n, thusa=b. Therefore, the mapping
Fix(φ)→XIwhich maps atoaIis injective and |Fix(φ)| ≤ |XI|.
2.3 Complete lattices
For a review of lattices, the reader is directed to the author itative monograph by Gr¨ azer [18]. A
complete lattice is a lattice L= (L,∨,∧,0,1) where every subset S⊆Lhas a well-deﬁned meet
and join:⋁S=⋁
x∈Sx∈Land⋀S=⋀
x∈Sx∈L. By convention, 0=⋁∅while1=⋀∅.
Theopposite of a complete lattice L= (L,∨,∧,0,1) is obtained by reversing the order: Lop=
(L,∧,∨,1,0). When referring to properties for the opposite lattice, we will either add the preﬁx “co-”
or use the preﬁxes “meet-” and “join-” in order to clarify bet weenLandLop.
We consider the following special kinds of complete lattice s; the containment relations amongst
them are represented in Figure 2.

(a) A complete lattice is distributive if for allx,y,z∈L,x∧(y∨z) = (x∧y)∨(x∧z).
(b) A complete lattice Lis aframe[21], also known as a complete Heyting algebra, if for all x∈L
andY⊆L,x∧⋁Y=⋁(x∧Y).
(c) The opposite of a frame is a locale, also known as a complete co-Heyting algebra.
(d) A lattice is complemented if any x∈Lhas a complement ¬x∈Lsuch thatx∨ ¬x=1and
x∧¬x=0. Acomplete Boolean algebra is a complemented, complete distributive lattice.
The complement is necessarily unique in a Boolean algebra. A thorough introduction to Boolean
algebras is given in [16].
(e) For any set V, its power set is denoted as P(V) and the power set lattice ofVisP(V) =
(L=P(V),∨=∪,∧=∩,0=∅,1=V). The power set lattice is a complete Boolean algebra,
where¬x=V\xfor allx⊆V.
(f) Acomplete chain is a complete lattice where all elements are comparable.
(g) Let us call a complete lattice with |L| ≤2trivial.
Say a complete lattice is ascending chain condition ( ACC) if all ascending chains are ﬁnite: if
(ai:i∈N) satisfyai+1≥aifor alli, then there exists nsuch thatam=anfor allm≥n. The
descending chain condition ( DCC) is deﬁned similarly: if ( bi:i∈N) satisfybi+1≤bifor alli, then
there exists nsuch thatbm=bnfor allm≥n.
For anyS⊆L, we denote S↓={y∈L:∃s∈S:y≤s}andS↑={y∈L:∃s∈S:y≥s}. We
denotex↑={x}↑andx↓={x}↓for allx∈L; those are the principal ﬁlters and ideals of the lattice,
respectively.
3 Graphs on lattices
In this section, we generalise the concept of graphs to all la ttices. We justify our generalisation by
proving multiple generalisations of classical results on d igraphs in our setting.
3.1 Graphs

x∈Sf(x)for allS⊆P(V).
Proof.It is clear that for any Dand anyS⊆P(V),D(⋃
x∈Sx) =⋃
x∈SD(x).
Conversely, suppose f(⋃
x∈Sx) =⋃
x∈Sf(x) for allS⊆P(V). First, note that f(∅) is the
empty union, i.e. f(∅) =∅. LetD= (V,E) withE={(u,v) :u,v∈V,u∈f(v)}. We prove
thatD(x) =f(x) for anyx∈P(V). Forx=∅,D(∅) =∅=f(∅). Forx={v}, we have
D(v) ={u:u∈f(v)}=f(v). For any other x∈P(V), we haveD(x) =⋃

LetL= (L,∨,∧,0,1) be a complete lattice. A graphonLis a mapping f:L→Lthat preserves
arbitrary joins, i.e. for all S⊆L,
f(⋁
x∈Sx)
=⋁
x∈Sf(x).
We shall reserve the term “digraph” for a graph on L=P(V), and make remarks about digraphs in
the subsequent observations throughout the paper.
We shall use the following shorthand notation: f(S) ={f(x) :x∈S}. As such, a graph is any
mappingffor which
f(⋁
S)
=⋁
f(S)
for allS⊆L. We note that, by taking S=∅, we obtain f(0) =0for any graph. Here are a few
examples of graphs:
(a)f(x) =0for allx∈Lis the empty graph;
(b)f(x) =1for allx̸=0is the complete graph;
(c)f= id is the identity graph;
(d) For any a∈L, letga:L→Lbe deﬁned by ga(x) =x∧afor allx∈L. ThenLis a frame if and
only ifgais a graph for all a∈L. If so, then for any graph fonL, the subgraph of finduced
byais the graph f[a] ona↓deﬁned byf[a](x) =gaf(x) =f(x)∧a.
The family of graphs on L, denoted by G, is closed under taking arbitrary joins and hence forms
a complete lattice [18, Chapter I, Section 3, Lemma 14]. Inde ed, ifF⊆ G, thenh=⋁F∈ G, since

f∈Ff(x) =⋁
x∈Sh(x).
The family of graphs Gis also closed under composition. We shall omit the composit ion symbol, and
writefgfor the mapping where fg(x) =f(g(x)) for allx∈L.
A graph on the opposite lattice Lopis aco-graph , i.e. a mapping g:L→Lsuch thatg(⋀S) =⋀g(S) for allS⊆L.
A mapping f:L→Lismonotone ifx≤y=⇒f(x)≤f(y) for allx,y∈L, or equivalently,

for allS⊆L. Clearly, graphs are monotone.
For any complete lattice Lwith at least two elements, it is easy to construct a monotone mapping
that is not a graph: f(x) =1for allx∈Lis not a graph since f(0)̸=0. Instead, we characterise
below the complete lattices where all monotone mappings ﬁxi ng0are graphs.
Proposition 3.1.2. All monotone mappings on Lﬁxing0are graphs if and only if Lis an ACC
chain.
8Proof.LetLbe an ACC chain, and let fbe monotone and ﬁx 0. For any nonempty S⊆Lwith
s=⋁S, we haves∈Sandf(t)≤f(s) for allt∈S, hencef(⋁S) =f(s) =⋁f(S). Conversely, if

3.2 Graphs as residuated mappings
Letψ:L→L. For anyS⊆L, the pre-image of Sunderψis denoted as usual: ψ−1(S) ={x∈L:
ψ(x)∈S}. We introduce two mappings ψ+,ψ−:L→Lsuch that for all a,b∈L,
ψ+(a) :=⋁
{x:ψ(x)≤a}=⋁
ψ−1(a↓),
ψ−(b) :=⋀
{y:ψ(y)≥b}=⋀
ψ−1(b↑).
Observation 3.2.1. For any digraph D,D+(x) ={v∈V:D(v)⊆x}.
Let us make some remarks in the general case, whose proofs are obvious and hence omitted. There
is a natural partial order on L→Lmappings, whereby ψ≥θif and only if ψ(x)≥θ(x) for allx∈L,
for anyψ,θ:L→L.
Lemma 3.2.2. Letψ,θ:L→L. Then the following hold:
(a)ψ+andψ−are monotone;
(b)ψ−ψ≤id≤ψ+ψ;
(c)ψ−+≤ψ≤ψ+−;
(d) ifψ≥θ, thenψ+≤θ+andψ−≤θ−.
A mapping f:L→Lisresiduated if the pre-image of every principal ideal is a principal idea l.
It is easy to see that a residuated mapping is monotone. Many c haracterisations and properties of
residuated mappings are given in [6, Chapter 2] and [5, Chapt er 1], some with proofs, others without
proofs, and others still only implicit. For the sake of compl eteness and clarity, we combine the key
properties that we need in the theorem below, for which we giv e a full proof.
Theorem 3.2.3 (Properties of residuated mappings on complete lattices) .LetLbe a complete lattice
and letf:L→L. Then the following are equivalent:
(1)fis residuated;
(2)fis a graph;
(3)ff+≤id.
Iffsatisﬁes any property above, then the following hold:
(a)f+is a co-graph;
(b)f=f+−;
9(c) for allx,y∈L,f(x)≤yif and only if x≤f+(y);
(d)ff+f=fandf+ff+=f+.
Proof.(2) =⇒(3). Iffis a graph, then for any a∈L, we have
ff+(a) =f(⋁
{x:f(x)≤a})
=⋁
f({x:f(x)≤a})≤a,
thusff+≤id.
(3) =⇒(2). Suppose ff+≤id and letS⊆L. Lety=⋁f(S), then for all s∈S,
f+(y)≥f+f(s)≥s,
thusf+(y)≥⋁Sandy≥ff+(y)≥f(⋁S).
(3)⇐⇒(1). Iffis not monotone, then it satisﬁes neither Property (1) (as re siduated mappings
are monotone) nor Property (3) (as it is equivalent to being a graph). Let fbe a monotone mapping,
so thatf−1(x↓) is an ideal for all x∈L. For alla∈L, we have the following equivalences:
ff+(a)≤a⇐⇒f(⋁
f−1(a↓))
≤a⇐⇒⋁
f−1(a↓)∈f−1(a↓)⇐⇒f−1(a↓) is a principal ideal .
We now prove that, if fis a graph, then fsatisﬁes Properties (a) to (d).
(a) LetS⊆L. On the one hand, f+(⋀S)≤⋀f+(S) by monotonicity. On the other hand, we have
f(⋀
f+(S))
≤⋀
ff+(S)≤⋀
S,
thus ⋀
f+(S)≤f+f(⋀
f+(S))
≤f+(⋀
S)
.
(b) Applying Property (3) to f+, a graph on the opposite lattice Lop, yieldsf+−f+≤id and
f+f+−≥id. Combining with Property (3) for f, we obtain
f≤ff+f+−≤f+−≤f+−f+f≤f.
(c) Letx,y∈L. Thanks to the monotonicity of fandf+and to Property (3), we have the following
implications:
f(x)≤y=⇒f+f(x)≤f+(y) =⇒x≤f+(y) =⇒f(x)≤ff+(y) =⇒f(x)≤y.
(d) Follows immediately from Property (3) and Lemma 3.2.2(b ).
3.3 Reﬂexive and transitive graphs
We now introducethreegraphsonthelattice of graphs G, namely thereﬂexive, transitive, andreﬂexive
transitive closures of graphs.
(a) A graph fisreﬂexive iff≥id. We denote the reﬂexive closure offasfR= id∨f. The
following are equivalent for a graph g:gis reﬂexive; g=gR;g=fRfor some graph f.
(b) A graph fistransitive iff≥f2. Thetransitive closure offisfT=⋁
i∈N1fi. The following
are equivalent for a graph g:gis transitive; g=gT;g=fTfor some graph f.
(c) A graph fisreﬂexive transitive iff2=f≥id. The reﬂexive transitive closure offis
thenfRT= (fT)R= (fR)T=⋁
i∈Nfi. Therefore, the following are equivalent for a graph g:g
is reﬂexive transitive; g=gRT;g=fRTfor some graph f.
10Reﬂexive and transitive digraphs are easily characterised ; see below (a loopon the vertex vis the
edge (v,v)). The proof is obvious and hence omitted.
Observation 3.3.1. A digraph is reﬂexive if and only if there is a loop on every ver tex. A digraph is
transitive if and only for all u,v,w∈V,(u,v),(v,w)∈Eimplies(u,w)∈E.
Our next aim is to relate the sets of ﬁxed points of fwith those of its diﬀerent closures. Firstly,
we say a graph gisnon-degenerate if its transitive closure is reﬂexive, i.e. gT(x)≥xfor allx.
Observation 3.3.2. A digraph is non-degenerate if and only if every vertex belon gs to a cycle.
Proof.SupposeDis non-degenerate. We have v∈DT(v) if and only if there exists isuch that
v∈Di(v), and hence there exists a cycle ( v=v0,v1,...,vi−1).
Conversely, suppose every vertex of Dbelongs to a cycle, that is for all v∈Vthere exists ivsuch
thatv∈Div(V). LetX⊆V, thenX⊆⋃
v∈XDiv(v)⊆DT(X).
Proposition 3.3.3. Letfbe a graph. We have
Fix(fT) = Fix(f)⊆Fix(fR) = Fix(fRT), (2)
whereFix(f) = Fix(fR)if and only if fis non-degenerate.
Proof.We ﬁrst prove Equation (2).
•Fix(f)⊆Fix(fR). Ifx=f(x), thenx=f(x)∨x.
•Fix(f)⊆Fix(fRT). Ifx=f(x), thenx=fi(x) for alli≥0, and hence x=fRT(x).
•Fix(fT) = Fix(f). The ﬁrst item shows that Fix( fT)⊆Fix(fRT). SincefT=ffRT, we have
for allx∈L,
fT(x) =x⇐⇒[
ffRT(x) =xandfRT(x) =x]
⇐⇒f(x) =x.
•Fix(fRT) = Fix(fR). Apply the previous item to fR.
We now prove that Fix( f) = Fix(fR) if and only if fis non-degenerate. If fis non-degenerate,
thenfT=fRT, so equality follows Equation (2). Otherwise, let z∈Lsuch thatfT(z)<fRT(z), and
lety=fRT(z). We then have f(y) =fT(z)<y, whilefRT(y) =yby idempotence of fRT.
LetXbeaﬁniteset. Thentopologies on Xareinone-to-onecorrespondencewithpartialpreorders,
i.e. reﬂexive and transitive relations on X[7, Theorem 3.9.1]. This fact, which we shall refer to
as the ﬁnite topology theorem, gives an equivalence between ﬁnite topologies and ﬁnite reﬂexive
transitive digraphs. In [11], that equivalence is reviewed in terms of disjunctive Boolean networks. It
is shown that ﬁnite topologies are exactly the sets of ﬁxed po ints of ﬁnite reﬂexive transitive digraphs,
which in turn are the same as the sets of ﬁxed points of non-deg enerate digraphs ([11] uses the term
“non-trivial” but this is not the most appropriate choice of terminology). We now generalise the
ﬁnite topology theorem to any complete lattice by consideri ng so-called bi-topologies. We give two
equivalent characterisations of such subsets of the lattic e, one for reﬂexive transitive graphs, the other
for non-degenerate graphs.
Abi-topology onLis a subset TofLwhich is closed under arbitrary joins and meets, i.e. such
that for any subset S⊆T,⋀S,⋁S∈T.
Theorem 3.3.4 (The bi-topology theorem) .LetLbe a complete lattice. Then the following are
equivalent for T⊆L.
(1)Tis a bi-topology on L;
(2)Tis the set of ﬁxed points of some reﬂexive transitive graph on L;
(3)Tis the set of ﬁxed points of some non-degenerate graph on L.
11Proof.(1) =⇒(2). Suppose Tis a bi-topology. Deﬁne h:L→Las follows. For all x∈L, let
Tx=T∩x↑; thenh(x) =⋀Tx. Clearly,his monotone and h≥id.
The ﬁxed point set of hisT. Indeed,h(x)∈Tfor allx, hence Fix( h)⊆T; conversely, h(t) =tif
t∈T.
In fact, we have just shown that his idempotent. Therefore, all that is left to prove is that his
a graph. Let S⊆L. On the one hand, h(⋁S)≥⋁h(S) by monotonicity. On the other hand, since⋁h(S)≥⋁Sand⋁h(S)∈T, we have⋁h(S)∈T⋁S, thus
⋁
h(S)≥⋀
T⋁S=h(⋁
S).
(2) =⇒(1).Conversely, let hbe a reﬂexive transitive graph. Because his a graph, its image set
(thesameasitssetofﬁxedpoints,as hisidempotent)isclosedunderarbitraryjoins:⋁h(S) =h(⋁S).
We now prove that Fix( h) is closed under arbitrary meets. Let S⊆Fix(h) andz=⋀S=⋀h(S).
On the one hand h(z)≥z, and on the other hand h(z)≤h(x) for allx∈Shenceh(z)≤z. Thus
h(z) =zandz∈Fix(h).
(2)⇐⇒(3). Follows from Proposition 3.3.3.
Aco-topology onLis a subset TofLwhich is closed under arbitrary meets and ﬁnite joins.
Equivalently, Tis a co-topology if 0,1∈T; for any subset S⊆T,⋀S∈T; and for all s,t∈T,
s∨t∈T. Apre-graph is a mapping g:L→Lthat preserves ﬁnite joins; reﬂexive, transitive, and
non-degenerate pre-graphs are deﬁned naturally. The proof of Theorem 3.3.4 can be easily adapted
to pre-graphs to yield the corresponding result for co-topo logies.
Corollary 3.3.5 (The co-topology theorem) .LetLbe a complete lattice. Then the following are
equivalent for T⊆L:
(1)Tis a co-topology on L;
(2)Tis the set of ﬁxed points of some reﬂexive transitive pre-gra ph onL;
(3)Tis the set of ﬁxed points of some non-degenerate pre-graph on L.
3.4 Fixed point-free graphs
We say a graph fisﬁxed point-free if0is the only ﬁxed point of f.
Let us ﬁrst classify the ﬁxed point-free digraphs. If a digra phDhas a cycle X, thenX⊆D(X)
and hence it is not ﬁxed-point free. Moreover, if Dis ﬁnite and acyclic, then X̸⊆D(X) for allX.
As such, a ﬁnite digraph is ﬁxed-point free if and only if it is acyclic. However, this is not true for
inﬁnite digraphs. A (forward) inﬁnite walk in a digraph is a sequence W= (wi:i∈N) of vertices
such that (wi,wi+1) is an arc for all i∈N.
Observation 3.4.1. A digraph is ﬁxed point-free if and only if it has no inﬁnite wa lks.
Proof.IfDhas an inﬁnite walk W= (wi:i∈N), thenD(W)⊇W, and hence Dis not ﬁxed
point-free.
Conversely, if Dis not ﬁxed point-free, let X̸=∅satisfyX=D(X). Then for all u∈X, there
existsv∈Xsuch that (u,v)∈E. As such, for any u∈X, there exists a sequence V= (vi:i∈N)
withv0=u,vi∈Xfor alli, and (vi,vi+1)∈Efor alli.
We now give several alternate deﬁnitions of ﬁxed point-free graphs.
Proposition 3.4.2. Letfbe a graph. Then the following are equivalent:
(1)fis ﬁxed point-free, i.e. Fix(f) ={0};
(2) for allx∈L,f(x)≥xif only ifx=0;
(3)f(x)<fR(x)for allx̸=0;
12...
(a) The ray...
(b) The backwards ray
Figure 3: The ray and backwards ray. The ray is not ﬁxed point- free while the backwards ray is.
(4) for allX⊆L,f(X)⊇Xonly ifX⊆ {0};
(5)Par(f) ={0}.
Proof.(1) =⇒(2). For the sake of contradiction, suppose f(u)≥ufor someu̸=0. Letv=fRT(u),
then we obtain
f(v) =f(⋁
i∈Nfi(u))
=⋁
i∈Nfi+1(u) =⋁
i∈Nfi(u) =v,
which is the desired contradiction.
(2) =⇒(1). Trivial.
(2)⇐⇒(3). For all x,f(x)̸≥x⇐⇒f(x)<f(x)∨x=fR(x).
(2) =⇒(4). For the sake of contradiction, suppose X⊆f(X) withq=⋁X >0. We have
f(q) =f(⋁
X)
=⋁
f(X)≥⋁
X=q,
which is the desired contradiction.
(4) =⇒(5). The proof follows Lemma 2.1.1.
(5) =⇒(1). Trivial.
Corollary 3.4.3. Iff≤gare graphs and gis ﬁxed point-free, then so is f.
Atopological sort forfis a linear order ⪯onLsuch thaty≤fT(x) only ifx≺yfor allx,y̸=0.
We remark that this deﬁnition diﬀers from that given for digra phs in [20], whereby the topological
sort was deﬁned for vertices only; in our deﬁnition, the topo logical sort for digraphs is deﬁned for all
subsets of vertices instead.
Theorem 3.4.4 (Topological sort of ﬁxed point-free graphs) .A graphfis ﬁxed point-free if and only
if it has a topological sort.
Proof.Letfbe ﬁxed point-free; note that fTis also ﬁxed point-free. We only need to show that the
relationy≤fT(x) is transitive, irreﬂexive (unless x=y=0), and antisymmetric on L. The relation
is clearly transitive and irreﬂexive. We now prove antisymm etry. Suppose fT(x)≥yandfT(y)≥x
fory̸=x. Firstly,x̸=0for otherwise, we have y≤fT(0) =0=x. Then
x≤fT(y)≤fT(fT(x))≤fT(x),
which contradicts the fact that fTis ﬁxed point-free.
Conversely, if f(x) =xwithx̸=0, thenx≤fT(x) andx̸≺xfor any linear order ⪯onL.
Example 3.4.5. Therayis the digraph on V=Nwith arcs {(i,i+ 1) :i∈N}. It is acyclic, but
not ﬁxed point-free, for f(V) =V. And indeed, one cannot place a topological sort on the verti ces
that extends to all subsets: for instance, if A,B⊆Vare two inﬁnite sets then DT(A) =V⊇Band
DT(B) =V⊇A.
Thebackwards ray is the digraph on V=Nwith arcs {(i,i−1) :i≥1}. It is acyclic, and
ﬁxed point-free. For any non-empty subsets x,ywe havey⊆DT(x)if and only if minx <miny.
Therefore, any linear order of P(V)such that miny>minx=⇒x≺yis a topological order.
Those digraphs are illustrated in Figure 3.
133.5 Meet-nilpotent graphs
We now introduce diﬀerent notions of nilpotence. First, meet -nilpotence, which as we shall see is well
suited for graphs:
•letK∈N, then we say ψ:L→LisK-meet-nilpotent ifψK(1) =0;
•we simply say ψismeet-nilpotent if it isK-meet-nilpotent for some K;
•we further say that ψisasymptotically meet-nilpotent if⋀
i∈Nψi(1) =0.
Second, join-nilpotence, which is well suited for co-graph s instead:
•letK∈N, then we say ψ:L→LisK-join-nilpotent ifψK(0) =1;
•we simply say ψisjoin-nilpotent if it isK-join-nilpotent for some K;
•we further say that ψisasymptotically join-nilpotent if⋁
i∈Nψi(0) =1.
Firstly, we focus on meet-nilpotent graphs. Let us characte rise the meet-nilpotent digraphs. A
ﬁnite walk of lengthlis a sequence of vertices ( w0,w1,...,w l) such that ( wi,wi+1) is an arc for all
0≤i≤l−1.
Observation 3.5.1. A digraphDisK-meet-nilpotent if and only if Dhas no walks of length K.
Proof.For anyi∈N,Di(V) is the set of vertices vsuch that there exists a walk of length istarting
fromv. Therefore, there exists a walk of length Kif and only if DK(V) is not empty.
We now prove that nilpotence behaves well within the theory o f residuated mappings.
Lemma 3.5.2. LetK∈N,ψ,θ:L→Landfbe a graph on L.
(a) IfψK(1) =0, thenψ+K(0) =1.
(b) IfθK(0) =1, thenθ−K(1) =0.
(c)fK(1) =0if and only if f+K(0) =1.
Proof. (a) By induction on 0 ≤i≤K, it is easily shown that ψ+i(0)≥ψK−i(1). In particular, for
i=Kwe obtainψ+K(0) =1.
(b) The proof is similar as the ﬁrst item.
(c) Easily follows from the ﬁrst two items.
Secondly, wefocusonasymptotically meet-nilpotent graph s. Thoseareﬁxedpoint-free: if f(x) =x
somex̸=0, then⋀fi(1)≥⋀fi(x) =x>0.
Let us classify the asymptotically meet-nilpotent digraph s. A collection of walks ( Wi:i∈N) in
Dwith a common starting vertex where Wihas lengthifor alliis called an inﬁnite pyramid .
Observation 3.5.3. A digraphDis asymptotically meet-nilpotent if and only if it has no inﬁ nite
pyramid.
Proof.Suppose there exists a family ( Wi:i∈N) of walks starting at vwith length ifor alli∈N,
and letwibe the end point of Wi. Thenv∈Di(wi)⊆Di(V) for alli, thus⋂
iDi(V)⊇ {v}andDis
not asymptotically meet-nilpotent.
Conversely, if Dhas no inﬁnite pyramid, then for every vertex v, thenv /∈Dd(V) for anydgreater
than the maximum length of a walk starting at v. Therefore,⋂
iDi(V) =∅, i.e.Dis asymptotically
meet-nilpotent.
14...
(a) Stairway to heaven...
(b) Stairway to hell
Figure 4: The stairway to heaven is is asymptotically meet-n ilpotent; the stairway to hell isn’t. Both
are ﬁxed point-free.
Example 3.5.4. We introduce two digraphs which shall be useful in the sequel of this paper.
Thestairway to heaven has vertex set V={a} ∪ {vj
i:j,i∈N,j≤i}and arc set E=
{(v0
i,a) :i∈N}∪{(vj
i,vj−1
i) : 1≤j≤i}(all arcs point towards a). Then the stairway to heaven is
asymptotically meet-nilpotent, as there is no inﬁnite pyra mid.
Thestairway to hell has vertex set V={a} ∪ {vj
i:j,i∈N,j≤i}and arc set E={(a,v0
i) :
i∈N} ∪ {(vj−1
i,vj
i) : 0≤j≤i−1}(all arcs point away from a). Then the stairway to hell is
not asymptotically meet-nilpotent, as it has the inﬁnite py ramid(Wi:i∈N)whereW0= (a)and
Wi+1= (a,v0
i,...,vi
i)for alli≥1.
Those digraphs are illustrated in Figure 4.
We now characterise the lattices for which all ﬁxed point-fr ee graphs are meet-nilpotent.
Proposition 3.5.5. Lis a DCC lattice if and only if all ﬁxed point-free graphs on Lare meet-nilpotent.
Proof.LetLbe DCC. If fis ﬁxed point-free, then it is easily proved (by induction on i) that either
fi(1) =0orfi+1(1)<fi(1). Thus the sequence ( fi(1) :i∈N,fi(1)>0) forms a descending chain,
and hence is ﬁnite, say of length K. Therefore, there exists Ksuch thatfK(1) =0.
IfLhas an inﬁnite descending chain D= (di:i∈N) withd0=1, then let
f(x) =⋁
D\x↑.
We claim that fis a graph, ﬁxed point-free, but not meet-nilpotent.
•Graph. Let S⊆Landq=⋁S↑, then we have D\q↑=⋃
s∈SD\s↑. We obtain
f(⋁
S)
=⋁
D\q↑=⋁
s∈S⋁
D\s↑=⋁
f(S).
•Fixed point-free. Suppose f(y) =yfory̸=0. Theny∈D, sayy=diandf(y) =di+1<y.
•Not meet-nilpotent. f(di) =di+1for alli∈N, thusfK(1) =dK>0for allK∈N.
Using a similar proof, we can characterise complete lattice s where all ﬁxed point-free graphs are
asymptotically meet-nilpotent.
Corollary 3.5.6. Every descending chain D= (di:i∈N)inLsatisﬁes⋀D=0if and only if all
ﬁxed point-free graphs on Lare asymptotically meet-nilpotent.
We now providediﬀerent characterisations and properties of asymptotically meet-nilpotent graphs,
which are summarised in Figure 5.

We ﬁrst explain and prove the contents of the ﬁrst box on Figur e 5. For all φ:L→L, we denote
B(φ) =⋂
i∈Nφi(L)↓,
C(φ) =(⋀
i∈Nφi(1))↓
.
Proposition 3.5.7. Letfbe a graph, then the following are equivalent.
(1)fis asymptotically meet-nilpotent, i.e.⋀
i∈Nfi(1) =0;
(2)B(f) ={0}.
(3)C(f) ={0}.
Lemma 3.5.8. Iffis monotone, then B(f) =C(f).
Proof.For anyφ:L→L, letD(φ) ={x∈L:∃(xi:i∈N),x=⋀
i∈Nφi(xi)}. We prove that
B(φ) =D(φ). We have
B(φ) =⋂
i∈Nφi(L)↓={x∈L:∃(xi:i∈N),x≤φi(xi)∀i∈N}.
Letx∈B(φ) withx≤φi(xi) for alli∈N. Deﬁnex′
0=xandx′
i=xifor alli≥1, then
x=⋀
i∈Nφi(x′
i), hencex∈D(φ). Conversely, let y∈D(φ) withy=⋀
i∈Nφi(yi), theny≤φi(yi) for
alli∈Nandy∈D(φ).
We now prove the lemma. Let b∈B(f) =D(f), then there exists ( bi:i∈N) such that
b=⋀
i∈Nfi(bi)≤⋀
i∈Nfi(1),
and henceb∈C(f). Conversely, let c∈C(f), thenc=c∧⋀
i∈Nfi(1). Therefore c=⋀
i∈Nfi(ci) for
c0= 0 andci=1for alli≥1, thusc∈B(f).
Proof of Proposition 3.5.7. (1)⇐⇒(3). For all x∈L,x=0if and only if x↓={0}. Applying this
tox=⋀
i∈Nfi(1) yields the desired equivalence.
(2)⇐⇒(3). Follows from Lemma 3.5.8.
We now prove the relationships between the ﬁrst two boxes on F igure 5. We begin with the black
and red arrows.
Lemma 3.5.9. Letfbe graph. If fis asymptotically meet-nilpotent, then Pyr(f) ={0}.
Proof.Letfbe asymptotically meet-nilpotent and let x∈Pyr(f), withfi(xi) =xfor alli∈N. We
then have
0=⋀
i∈Nfi(1)≥⋀
i∈Nfi(xi) =x.
16Example 3.5.10. On the other hand, there exists Landfsuch that Pyr(f) ={0}andfis not
asymptotically meet-nilpotent. Let L= [0,1]equipped with the natural order, u∈(0,1)and
f(x) ={
x
2ifx≤u
x+u
2otherwise.
It is easy to check the following properties: fis a graph; Pyr(f) ={0};⋀
i∈Nfi(1) =u.
The result on power set lattices is transparent.
Observation 3.5.11. For any digraph D, we have
C(D) = Pyr(D)↓.
Therefore,Dis asymptotically meet-nilpotent if and only if Pyr(D) ={∅}.
4 Robert’s theorem for mappings over complete lattices
4.1 Four kinds of dependency
Robert’s theorem for ﬁnite automata networks relies on the c oncept of interaction graph, i.e. the
smallest graph on which a network depends. Unfortunately, t he interaction graph does not necessarily
exist for general lattices, not even for L=P(V) with inﬁnite V, as we shall see in Example 4.1.2.
Instead, we generalise the concept, reviewed in Section 2.2 , of a mapping depending on a digraph to
all lattices in two ways, thus yielding four kinds of depende ncy.
LetLbe a complete lattice and φ,α,β,γ,δ :L→L.
(α) We sayφpre-meet-depends onαif for allx,y,s∈L,
x∧α(s) =y∧α(s) =⇒φ(x)∧s=φ(y)∧s.
(β) We sayφpre-join-depends onβif for allx,y,s∈L,
x∨β(s) =y∨β(s) =⇒φ(x)∨s=φ(y)∨s.
(γ) We sayφpost-meet-depends onγif for allx,y,s∈L,
x∧s=y∧s=⇒φ(x)∧γ(s) =φ(y)∧γ(s).
(δ) We sayφpost-join-depends onδif for allx,y,s∈L,
x∨s=y∨s=⇒φ(x)∨δ(s) =φ(y)∨δ(s).
It is clear that any mapping φpre-meet-depends on the mapping α∗withα∗(x) =1for allx∈L.
Therefore, it is interesting to understand the minimal mapp ings on which φpre-meet-depends. The
lemma below gathers the corresponding observations for all four kinds of dependency.
Lemma 4.1.1. Letφ,α,¯α,β,¯β,γ,¯γ,δ,¯δ:L→L. Then the following hold.
(α) Ifφpre-meet-depends on αand¯α≥α, thenφpre-meet-depends on ¯α.
(β) Ifφpre-join-depends on βand¯β≤β, thenφpre-join-depends on ¯β.
(γ) Ifφpost-meet-depends on γand¯γ≤γ, thenφpost-meet-depends on ¯γ.
(δ) Ifφpost-join-depends on δand¯δ≥δ, thenφpost-join-depends on ¯δ.
We illustrate in the next example why it makes sense to genera lise dependency to all mappings,
instead of only graphs, even for power set lattices.

0ifxis ﬁnite
1otherwise.
We can readily characterise on which mappings ωdepends; the proof is a simple exercise.
(α)ωpre-meet-depends on αif and only if α(s)is co-ﬁnite for all s̸=0.
(β)ωpre-join-depends on βif and only if β(t)is ﬁnite for all t̸=1.
(γ)ωpost-meet-depends on γif and only if γ(s) =0ifsis not co-ﬁnite.
(δ)ωpost-join-depends on δif and only if δ(t) =1iftis inﬁnite (i.e. δ≥ω).
As a consequence, we now give an example of mapping ˆαsuch thatωpre-meet-depends on ˆαbut
ωdoes not pre-meet-depend on any monotone mapping (let alone graph)f≤ˆα. Namely, let ˆαsuch
thatˆα(s) =sfor allsco-ﬁnite and ˆα(s) =1otherwise. Let f≤ˆαbe monotone, then for any ﬁnite s,
f(s)≤⋀
{f(x) :s≤x,xco-ﬁnite} ≤⋀
{ˆα(x) :s≤x,xco-ﬁnite}=⋀
{x:s≤x,xco-ﬁnite}=s.
Thusf(s)is ﬁnite, and hence ωdoes not pre-meet-depend on f.
As seen from Example 4.1.2, even when Lis a power set lattice, we cannot assume without loss
thatφpre-meet-depends on a monotone mapping α. However, whenever Lis a frame, we can assume
without loss of generality that φpost-meet-depends on a monotone mapping γ.
Lemma 4.1.3. LetLbe a frame and γ:L→L. Then there exists a monotone mapping Γ :L→L
such that Γ≥γand for all φ:L→L,φpost-meet-depends on γif and only if φpost-meet-depends
onΓ.
Proof.Deﬁne Γ :L→Lby Γ(a) =⋁
b≤aγ(b). We note that Γ ≥γand that Γ is monotone. Suppose
φpost-meet-depends on γ. For allx,y,s∈L, we have
x∧s=y∧s⇐⇒x∧t=y∧tfor allt≤s
=⇒φ(x)∧γ(t) =φ(y)∧γ(t) for allt≤s
=⇒⋁
t≤s(φ(x)∧γ(t)) =⋁
t≤s(φ(y)∧γ(t))
⇐⇒φ(x)∧Γ(s) =φ(y)∧Γ(s).
Thus,φpost-meet-depends on Γ. Conversely, suppose φpost-meet-depends on Γ. Since γ≤Γ,φ
post-meet-depends on γas well.
The four kinds of dependency are related to one another, than ks to residuation.
Lemma 4.1.4. Letφ,α,β,γ,δ :L→L.
(α) Ifφpost-meet-depends on α+, thenφpre-meet-depends on α.
(β) Ifφpost-join-depends on β−, thenφpre-join-depends on β.
(γ) Ifφpre-meet-depends on γ−, thenφpost-meet-depends on γ.
(δ) Ifφpre-join-depends on δ+, thenφpost-join-depends on δ.
Proof.(α) Ifφpost-meet-depends on α+, then for all x,y,s∈L
x∧α(s) =y∧α(s) =⇒φ(x)∧α+(α(s)) =φ(y)∧α+(α(s)) =⇒φ(x)∧s=φ(y)∧s,
whenceφpre-meet-depends on α.

whenceφpost-meet-depends on γ.

Corollary 4.1.5. Letφ:L→Land letfbe a graph on L.
(a)φpre-meet-depends on fif and only if φpost-meet-depends on f+.
(b)φpost-join-depends on fif and only if φpre-join-depends on f+.
Letfbe a graph. We remark that fpre-join-depends on f+:
x∨f+(s) =y∨f+(s) =⇒f(x∨f+(s)) =f(y∨f+(s))
=⇒f(x)∨ff+(s) =f(y)∨ff+(s)
=⇒f(x)∨s=f(y)∨s.
In fact, the dependency relations between fandf+are represented in Figure 6, where the head of
each arc depends on the tail of the arc. For instance, the fact thatfpre-join-depends on f+is the
blue arc at the top. The proofs of the diﬀerent dependencies ar e straightforward and hence omitted.
4.2 Meet-metric and meet-complete mappings
The aim of this subsection is to deﬁne mappings for which we sh all be able to apply the (bounded
or complete) Banach contraction principle. Firstly, the me et-metric property provides us with a
contractive mapping on a bounded metric space (not necessar ily complete) and hence guarantees that
there is at most one pyramidal point; accordingly, this will also be the basis for the feedback bound.
Secondly, the meet-complete property provides us with a bou nded complete metric space and hence
guarantees strong convergence towards a ﬁxed point. Lastly , the weakest property is meet-covering,
which is perhaps the simplest to state from a lattice point of view, and is actually equivalent to
meet-complete for frames.
Considerasequence A= (ai:i∈N) of elements of L. For allx∈LwedenoteAx= (x∧ai:i∈N),
so thatA=A1. We remark that x≥⋁Ax; we shall use this fact repeatedly in the sequel. For any
s,t∈L, let ∆ A(s,t) ={i∈N:s∧ai̸=t∧ai}anddA(s,t) =∑
i∈∆A(s,t)2−i. ThendAis a bounded
pseudometric, i.e. it satisﬁes all the axioms of a metric apa rt from the identity of indiscernibles. We
then say that Ais
(a)meet-covering ifdA(x,1)̸= 0 for allx̸=1;
(b)meet-metric ifdAis a bounded metric;
(c)meet-complete if (L,dA) is a bounded complete metric space.
Join-covering ,join-metric andjoin-complete sequences are deﬁnedsimilarly, by placing ourselves
in the opposite lattice Lop.
We ﬁrst give purely lattice-theoretic characterisations o f these three properties.
19Proposition 4.2.1. LetAbe a sequence of elements of L. ThenAis meet-covering if and only if⋁A=1.
Proof.Suppose⋁A=1. IfdA(x,1) = 0, then Ax=A1=Aand hence
x≥⋁
Ax=⋁
A=1.
Conversely, suppose dA(x,1)̸= 0 for all x̸=1. Supposeb=⋁A<1, thenAb=A=A1and hence
b=1.
Proposition 4.2.2. LetAbe a sequence of elements of L. The following are equivalent:
(1)x=⋁Axfor allx∈L;
(2)Ax=Ayimpliesx=yfor allx,y∈L;
(3)Ais meet-metric, i.e. dAis a bounded metric over L.
Proof.(1)⇐⇒(2). For any sequence Aand anyx∈L, letz=⋁Ax. On the one hand, x≥z,
hencez∧ai≤x∧ai, and on the other hand
z∧ai=ai∧⋁
j(x∧aj)≥ai∧(x∧ai) =x∧ai,
thusAz=Ax. Therefore, if Adoes not satisfy Property(1), wehave Az=Axwhilez̸=x. Conversely,
ifAsatisﬁes Property (1), then for all x,y∈LwithAx=Ay, we havex=⋁Ax=⋁Ay=y.
(2)⇐⇒(3). The identity of indiscernibles for dAis equivalent to Property (2).
Say a sequence Z= (zi:i∈N) isstrongly Cauchy (forA) ifi≥jimplieszi∧aj=zj∧aj.
DeﬁneAZ= (zi∧ai:i∈N). A simple exercise veriﬁes that a strongly Cauchy sequence forAis
indeed a Cauchy sequence for dA.
Proposition 4.2.3. A sequence Ais meet-complete if and only if it is meet-metric and for all s trongly
CauchyZ,AZ=Azforz=⋁AZ.
Proof.LetAbe meet-complete. Then Ais meet-metric by deﬁnition. Now, let Z= (zi:i∈N) be
strongly Cauchy and suppose Ab̸=AZfor allb∈L. Then there exists j∈Nsuch thatb∧aj̸=
zj∧aj=zi∧ajfor alli≥j. Therefore, dA(b,zi)≥2−jfor alli≥jandZdoes not converge towards
b, which contradicts the fact that ( L,dA) is a complete metric space. Thus, there exists b∈Lwith
Ab=AZ. But then b=⋁Ab, which ﬁnally gives b=⋁Ab=⋁AZ=z.
Conversely, suppose Ais meet-metric and for all strongly Cauchy Z,AZ=Az. We now prove that
(L,dA) forms a complete metric space. Let Y= (yi:i∈N) be a Cauchy sequence. For all k∈N, let
N(k) = min{M:dA(yi,yj)<2−k∀i,j≥M}and deﬁne the sequence Z= (zk=yN(k):k∈N). Then
for alli≥N(k), we haveyi∧ak=yN(k)∧ak=zk∧ak. In particular for i=N(l) for somel≥k, we
obtainzl∧ak=zk∧ak, that isZis a strongly Cauchy sequence with AZ=Az. Now, letǫ>0 and
ksuch that 2−k<ǫ, then for all i≥N(k),dA(z,yi)<ǫ, that isYconverges towards z.
We now give suﬃcient conditions for a sequence to be meet-com plete.
Proposition 4.2.4. If one of the following holds, then Ais meet-complete:
(a)an=1for somen∈N;
(b)Lis distributive and⋁T=1for some ﬁnite T⊆A;
(c)Lis a frame and⋁A=1.
Proof. (a) We already proved that⋁Ax≤xfor allxin the proof of Proposition 4.2.2. If an=1,
then⋁Ax=⋁
ix∧ai≥x∧an=x. LetZbe strongly Cauchy, then for all i≥n,zi=zi∧an=
zn∧an=zn, so the sequence is eventually stationary. For all j≤n, we havezn∧aj=zj∧aj
so thatAZ=Aznandzn=⋁AZ.
20(b) Without loss, suppose T={1,...,τ}. For anyx∈L, we have
⋁
(x∧T) =x∧⋁
T=x.
LetZbe strongly Cauchy. If t≤τ≤s, we have
zs∧at=zt∧at=zτ∧at,
thuszs∧⋁T=zτ∧⋁T, whencezs=zτfor alls≥τ. For allt≤τ, we havezτ∧zt=zt∧at
so thatAZ=Azτandzτ=⋁AZ.
(c) For any x∈L, we have⋁
Ax=⋁
(x∧A) =x∧⋁
A=x.
LetZbe strongly Cauchy, and let z=⋁AZ, then
z∧ai=ai∧⋁
(zj∧aj)≥ai∧zi∧ai=zi∧ai
and on the other hand
z∧ai=ai∧⋁
j(zj∧aj) =⋁
k<i(zk∧ak∧ai)∨⋁
j≥i(zj∧ai∧aj) =⋁
k<i(zi∧ak∧ai)∨⋁
j≥i(zi∧ai∧aj)≤zi∧ai.
ThusAz=AZ.
Corollary 4.2.5. IfLis a frame and Ais meet-covering, then Ais meet-complete.
We can now deﬁne four kinds of -complete mappings, each corre sponding to a kind of dependency.
LetLbe a complete lattice and α,β,γ,δ :L→L.
(α) Sayα:L→Lispre-meet-complete if there exists a meet-complete sequence A= (ai:i∈N)
witha0=0andα(ai)≤ai−1for alli≥1.
(β) Sayβ:L→Lispre-join-complete if there exists a join-complete sequence B= (bi:i∈N)
withb0=1andβ(bi)≥bi−1for alli≥1.
(γ) Sayγ:L→Lispost-meet-complete if there exists a meet-complete sequence C= (ci:i∈N)
withc0=0andγ(ci−1)≥cifor alli≥1.
(δ) Sayδ:L→Lispost-join-complete if there exists a join-complete sequence D= (di:i∈N)
withd0=1andδ(di−1)≤difor alli≥1.
We then say αisA-pre-meet-complete, and similarly for β,γ, andδ. The corresponding -covering
and -metric mappings are deﬁned similarly.
For anyψ:L→L, we deﬁne the following two sequences:
M(ψ) = (ψi(0) :i∈N)
J(ψ) = (ψi(1) :i∈N).
We note that ψis asymptotically join-nilpotent (⋁ψi(0) =1) if and only if M( ψ) is meet-covering.
Similarly,ψis asymptotically meet-nilpotent (⋀ψi(1) =0) if and only if J( ψ) is join-covering. Those
two sequences are also closely related to -covering/metric /complete mappings, as seen in Proposition
4.2.6 below.
Proposition 4.2.6. LetLbe a complete lattice and α,β,γ,δ :L→L. Then the following hold.
(α) Ifαis pre-meet-covering/metric, then M(α+)is meet-covering/metric. Conversely, if αis a
graph and M(α+)is meet-covering/metric/complete, then αis pre-meet-covering/metric/complete.
21(β) Ifβis pre-join-covering/metric, then J(β−)is join-covering/metric. Conversely, if βis a co-
graph and J(β−)is join-covering/metric/complete, then βis pre-join-covering/metric/complete.
(γ) Ifγis monotone and post-meet-covering/metric, then M(γ)is meet-covering/metric. Con-
versely, if M(γ)is meet-covering/metric/complete, then γis post-meet-covering/metric/complete.
(δ) Ifδis monotone and post-join-covering/metric, then J(δ)is join-covering/metric. Conversely,
ifJ(δ)is join-covering/metric/complete, then δis post-join-covering/metric/complete.
The proof uses the following lemma.
Lemma 4.2.7. LetAandBare two sequences of elements in Land suppose B≥A. IfAis
meet-covering, then so is B. Similarly, if Ais meet-metric, then so is B.
Proof.We prove that dB≥dA. Letx,y∈L, then for all i∈N,
x∧bi=y∧bi=⇒x∧bi∧ai=y∧bi∧ai=⇒x∧ai=y∧ai.
Thus ∆ A(x,y)⊆∆B(x,y) anddB(x,y)≥dA(x,y).
Therefore, if Ais meet-covering, then dB(x,1)≥dA(x,1)>0 for allx̸=1andBis also meet-
covering. The proof is similar for meet-metric.
Proof of Proposition 4.2.6. (α) LetM(α+) = (mi=α+i(0) :i∈N). Ifαispre-meet-covering/metric,
then letA= (ai:i∈N) be a meet-covering/metric sequence with a0=0andα(ai)≤ai−1
for alli≥1. It is easily shown by induction that ai≤mifor alli∈N, thus M(α+) is
pre-meet-covering/metric by Lemma 4.2.7. Conversely, if αis a graph and M( α+) is meet-
covering/metric/complete, then m0=0, andα(mi) =α(α+(mi−1))≤mi−1for alli≥1, and
henceαis pre-meet-covering/metric/complete.
(β) Same proof as above for Lop.
(γ) Let M(γ) = (mi=γi(0) :i∈N). Ifγispost-meet-covering/metric, thenlet C= (ci:i∈N)bea
meet-covering/metric sequence with c0=0andγ(ci−1)≥cifor alli≥1. Then ifγis monotone,
it is easily shown by induction that ci≤mifor alli∈N, thus M(γ) is meet-covering/metric.
Conversely, if M( γ) is meet-covering/metric/complete, then m0=0, andγ(mi−1) =mifor all
i≥1, and hence γis post-meet-covering/metric/complete.
(δ) Same proof as above for Lop.
4.3 Robert’s theorem for mappings on complete lattices
In this subsection, we give our generalised Robert’s theore m. We shall study its tightness in the
following subsection. Robert’s theorem comes in four kinds , one for each kind of dependency. The
overall picture for pre-meet-dependency is displayed in Fi gure 7, while the overall picture for post-
join-dependency is displayed in Figure 8.
Theorem 4.3.1 (Robert’s theorem for mappings over complete lattices) .LetLbe a complete lattice
and letφ,α,β,γ,δ :L→L.
(α) SupposeαisA-pre-meet-metric and φpre-meet-depends on α. The following hold.
(a) There exists e∈Lsuch thate=⋁
iφi(x)∧aifor allx∈L.
(b) Ifφhas a pyramidal point, then φstrongly converges to e.
(c) IfαisA-pre-meet-complete, then φstrongly converges to e.
(d) IfαisK-meet-nilpotent, then e=φK(x)for allx∈L.
(β) SupposeβisB-pre-join-metric and φpre-join-depends on β. The following hold.
22(a) There exists e∈Lsuch thate=⋀
iφi(x)∨bifor allx∈L.
(b) Ifφhas a pyramidal point, then φstrongly converges to e.
(c) IfβisB-pre-join-complete, then φstrongly converges to e.
(d) IfβisK-join-nilpotent, then e=φK(x)for allx∈L.
(γ) SupposeγisC-post-meet-metric and φpost-meet-depends on γ. The following hold.
(a) There exists e∈Lsuch thate=⋁
iφi(x)∧cifor allx∈L.
(b) Ifφhas a pyramidal point, then φstrongly converges to e.
(c) IfγisC-post-meet-complete, then φstrongly converges to e.
(d) IfγisK-join-nilpotent, then e=φK(x)for allx∈L.
(δ) SupposeδisD-post-join-metric and φpost-join-depends on δ. The following hold.
(a) There exists e∈Lsuch thate=⋀
iφi(x)∨difor allx∈L.
(b) Ifφhas a pyramidal point, then φstrongly converges to e.
(c) IfδisD-post-join-complete, then φstrongly converges to e.
(d) IfδisK-meet-nilpotent, then e=φK(x)for allx∈L.
Proof.We only give the proofs for ( α); the other proofs are similar and hence omitted.
(a) Letx,y∈L. By induction on i, we prove that φi(x)∧ai=φi(y)∧ai. Therefore⋁
iφi(x)∧ai=⋁
iφi(y)∧ai, which is a point on the lattice.
(b) We prove that for any x,y∈L, ∆A(φ(x),φ(y))⊆∆A(x,y)+1. First, since a0=0,φ(x)∧a0=
φ(y)∧a0and 0/∈∆A(φ(x),φ(y)). Second, for i≥1 we have
x∧ai−1=y∧ai−1=⇒x∧α(ai) =y∧α(ai) =⇒φ(x)∧ai=φ(y)∧ai.
Therefore, if j∈∆A(φ(x),φ(y)), thenj−1∈∆A(x,y).
This proves that the mapping φis1
2-contractive for dA. The bounded Banach contraction
principle then shows that if φhas a pyramidal point, then it strongly converges to its uniq ue
ﬁxed point. We prove that the only possible ﬁxed point is e. Letu∈Fix(φ), then
u=⋁
Au=⋁
iu∧ai=⋁
iφi(u)∧ai=e.
(c) The complete Banach contraction principle guarantees t he existence of a ﬁxed point in this case.
(d) It is easily shown by induction on 0 ≤i≤K, that for all x,y∈L,φi(x)∧αK−i(1) =φi(y)∧
αK−i(1). In particular, for i=Kwe obtainφK(x) =φK(y).
4.4 Tightness of Robert’s theorem
In this section, we show that the hypotheses in Robert’s theo rem cannot be relaxed much further
without aﬀecting the corresponding results.
We ﬁrst give three counterexamples for pre-meet-dependenc y (item (α) in Theorem 4.3.1).
First, we give a counterexample to: “If αis pre-meet-complete, then φK=efor someK.” We
give it for a power set lattice.
Example 4.4.1. Letφbe the backwards ray and αbe the ray. Then it is easily shown that φpre-
meet-depends on α(we shall make this connection more obvious in Section 5.2), and thatαis pre-
meet-complete. However, we have φK(N) =NKfor allK.

amples, the violet arrows represent implications that hold when Lis a locale, the cyan arrows

24Second, we give a counterexample to: “If αis pre-meet-metric, then φ։e.” That statement holds
for frames, and we give a counterexample for a non-distribut ive lattice.
Example 4.4.2. LetLbe given as follows. Let L=A∪B∪ {1}, whereA= (ai:i∈N)and
B= (bi:i∈N)are inﬁnite ascending chains and a0=b0=0. We then have ai∧bj=bkwhere
k= min{i−1,j}.
It is easily shown that Ais meet-metric, i.e. x=⋁
ix∧aifor allx∈L. Let us show that Ais not
meet-complete. The sequence Bis strongly Cauchy for A, sincei≥jimpliesbi∧aj=bj−1=bj∧aj.
However, it does not have a limit: if x=bj, thenx∧aj+1=bjwhilebi∧aj+1=bj+1for alli≥j+1;
ifx /∈B, thenx∧ai/∈Bwhilebj∧ai∈B.
Letα:L→Lbe deﬁned as α(ai+1) =aifor alli∈Nandα(x) =1for allx /∈A. Sincea0=0
andα(ai)≤ai−1for alli≥1,αis pre-meet-metric.
Letφ:L→Lbe deﬁned as
φ(x) ={
bi+1ifx=bi
0otherwise.
Thenφhas no pyramidal points. All that is left to show is that φpre-meet-depends on α. Letx,y,s∈L
withx̸=yand suppose x∧α(s) =y∧α(s); we need to prove that φ(x)∧s=φ(y)∧s. This is clear
fors=0ors /∈A. Therefore, we can assume s=ai+1for somei≥0(and hence α(s) =ai). We
now perform a case analysis on xandy.
(a)x,y /∈B. Thenφ(x) =φ(y).
(b)x /∈B,y∈B. We havei= 0, for otherwise x∧ai∈Awhiley∧ai∈B, hencex∧α(s)̸=y∧α(s).
Therefore,φ(x)∧a1=φ(y)∧a1=0.
(c)x,y∈B. Thenx=bkandy=blwithk,l≥i−1. We then have
φ(x)∧ai+1=bk+1∧ai+1=bi=bl+1∧ai+1=φ(y)∧ai+1.
This example is illustrated in Figure 9.

Figure 9: The counterexample given in Example 4.4.2.
25Third, we give a counterexample to: “If αis pre-meet-covering, then |Fix(φ)| ≤1.” Again, this
statement holds for frames and our counterexample is for a no n-distributive lattice. The counterex-
ample actually has two ﬁxed points but replacing {b}in the example below by any arbitrary antichain
Byields as many ﬁxed points as we want.
Example 4.4.3. LetLbe deﬁned as follows. Let L=A∪ {b}∪ {1}, whereA= (ai:i∈N)is an
inﬁnite ascending chain with a0=0and⋁A=1, andb∧ai=0,b∨ai=1for allai∈A.
Letαbe the graph with α(0) =0,α(ai) =ai−1for alli≥1, andα(b) =α(1) =1. Letφwith
φ(x) ={
bifx=b
0otherwise.
ThenFix(φ) ={0,b}. All that is left to prove is that φpre-meet-depends on α. Letx,y,s∈Lwith
x̸=yand suppose x∧α(s) =y∧α(s); we need to prove that φ(x)∧s=φ(y)∧s. This is clear for
s /∈ {b,1}, since in that case φ(u)∧s=0for allu∈L. Ifs∈ {b,1}, thenα(s) =1, thusx=yand
we are done.
This example is illustrated in Figure 10.

Figure 10: The counterexample given in Example 4.4.3.
We now give three counterexamples for post-join-dependenc y (item (δ) in Theorem 4.3.1). All
those counterexamples will be closely linked to their count erparts for pre-meet-dependency; as such,
we shall omit the proofs.
First, we give a counterexample to: “If δis post-join-complete, then φK=e.”
Example 4.4.4. Letφ=δbe the backwards ray. Then δis post-join-complete, φsatisﬁesφi(N) =Ni
for alli∈N, andφpost-join-depends on δ.
Second, we give a counterexample to: “If δis post-join-metric, then φ։e.”
Example 4.4.5. We consider the lattice opposite to the one in Example 4.4.2. LetL=A∪B∪{0},
whereA= (ai:i∈N)andB= (bi:i∈N)are inﬁnite descending chains and a0=b0=1. We then
haveai∨bj=bkwherek= min{i−1,j}. ThenAis a join-metric but not join-complete sequence.
Letδ:L→Lbe deﬁned as δ(ai) =ai+1for alli∈Nandδ(x) =1for allx /∈A. Thenδis
A-pre-meet-metric.
26Letφ:L→Lbe deﬁned as
φ(x) ={
bi+1ifx=bi
1otherwise.
Thenφhas no pyramidal points and φpost-join-depends on δ.
Third, we give a counterexample to: “If δis post-join-covering, then |Fix(φ)| ≤1.”
Example 4.4.6. We consider the lattice opposite to the one in Example 4.4.3. LetL=A∪{b}∪{0},
whereA= (ai:i∈N)is an inﬁnite descending chain with a0=1and⋀A=0, andb∨ai=1,
b∧ai=0for allai∈A.
Letδbe deﬁned as δ(ai) =ai−1for alli∈N, andδ(b) =δ(0) =1. Letφwith
φ(x) ={
bifx=b
1otherwise.
ThenFix(φ) ={1,b}andφpost-join-depends on δ.
4.5 Feedback bounds
While Robert’s theorem was based on -complete mappings, the feedback bound is based on -metric
mappings instead. Since there are four kinds of dependency, we obtain four kinds of feedback bounds.
The four kinds of feedback vertex set (FVS) we consider here a re deﬁned as follows. Let Lbe a
complete lattice and α,β,γ,δ :L→L.
(α) Saya∈Lis apre-meet-FVS ofαif there exists a meet-metric sequence A= (ai:i∈N) with
a0=aandα(ai)≤ai−1for alli≥1.
(β) Sayb∈Lis apre-join-FVS ofβif there exists a join-metric sequence B= (bi:i∈N) with
b0=bandβ(bi)≥bi−1for alli≥1.
(γ) Sayc∈Lis apost-meet-FVS ofγif there exists a meet-metric sequence C= (ci:i∈N) with
c0=candγ(ci−1)≥cifor alli≥1.
(δ) Sayd∈Lis apost-join-FVS ofδif there exists a join-metric sequence D= (di:i∈N) with
d0=dandδ(di−1)≤difor alli≥1.
Theorem 4.5.1 (Feedback bound for complete lattices) .Letφ,α,β,γ,δ :L→L. Then the following
hold.
(α) Letφpre-meet-depend on αwith pre-meet-FVS a. Then|Fix(φ)| ≤ |a↓|.
(β) Letφpre-join-depend on βwith pre-join-FVS b. Then|Fix(φ)| ≤ |b↑|.
(γ) Letφpost-meet-depend on γwith post-meet-FVS c. Then|Fix(φ)| ≤ |c↓|.
(δ) Letφpost-join-depend on δwith post-join-FVS d. Then|Fix(φ)| ≤ |d↑|.
Proof.We only give the proof of ( α); the other three proofs are similar and hence omitted.
We prove that if s,t∈Fix(φ) satisfys∧a=t∧a, thens=t. Similarly to the proof of Theorem
4.3.1, by induction we have s∧ai=t∧aifor alli∈N, and hence As=At. SinceAis meet-metric,
we obtains=t.

5 Complete Boolean algebras
5.1 Transpose and symmetric graphs
In this section, Lis a complete Boolean algebra. For any ψ:L→L, let thedualofψbe the mapping
ψ∗:L→Ldeﬁned by
ψ∗(x) =¬ψ(¬x).
We deﬁne the transpose ofψas
ψ⊤:=ψ+∗.
Theco-transpose ofψis naturally deﬁned as ψ⊥=ψ−∗.
Let us make some quick remarks about the dual and the transpos e:
•fis a graph if and only if f∗is a co-graph;
•f⊤is a graph if and only if fis a graph and similarly g⊥is a co-graph if and only if gis a
co-graph;
•for anyψ:L→L,ψ⊤=ψ+∗=ψ∗−andψ⊥=ψ−∗=ψ∗+.
We obtain the commutative diagram in Figure 11, where fis a graph, and g=f+.
Observation 5.1.1. The transpose of a digraph is obtained by reversing the direct ion of all the arcs.
The main properties of the transpose graph are gathered in th e theorem below.
Theorem 5.1.2. LetLbe a complete Boolean algebra. The following hold.
(a) For any graph f,f⊤⊤=f.
(b) The transpose mapping f↦→f⊤is a graph and a co-graph on the lattice of graphs.
(c) For any graphs f,gwe have (fg)⊤=g⊤f⊤.
(d) For any graph f,f⊤T=fT
⊤andf⊤R=fR
⊤.
Proof. (a) We have
f⊤⊤=f+∗∗−=f+−=f.
(b) IfF⊆ Gis a family of graphs, then⋁Fis a graph satisfying
(⋁
F)
+=⋀
F+.
28Indeed, let h=⋁Fandi=⋀F+. We haveh≥ffor anyf∈F, henceh+≤⋀F+=i; on the
other hand, i≤f+for allf∈F, hencei−≥⋁F+−=⋁F=h, thusi≤h+.
For any collection Ψ of L→Lmappings, we have (⋀Ψ)∗=⋁Ψ∗, thanks to the inﬁnite De
Morgan’s laws. Therefore,
(⋁
F)
⊤=(⋁
F)
+∗=(⋀
F+)
∗=⋁
F+∗=⋁
F⊤.
Thusf↦→f⊤is a graph on the lattice of graphs G.
We have proved that the transposition mapping is a residuate d involution. According to [5,
Exercise 1.14], the transpose mapping is its own residual, a nd in particular, it is a co-graph.
(c) Firstly, ( fg)+=g+f+, since for all x,y∈Lwe have
fg(x)≤y⇐⇒g(x)≤f+(y)⇐⇒x≤g+f+(y).
Secondly, (fg)∗=f∗g∗, since for all x∈Lwe have
(fg)∗(x) =¬f(g(¬x)) =¬f(¬¬g(¬x)) =¬f(¬g∗(x)) =f∗g∗(x).
Thus,
(fg)⊤= (fg)+∗= (f+g+)∗=g+∗f+∗=g⊤f⊤.
(d) Firstly, we have
fT
⊤=
⋁
i∈N1fi

⊤=⋁
i∈N1fi
⊤=⋁
i∈N1f⊤i=f⊤T.
Secondly, id += id and id ∗= id, therefore id ⊤= id. Thus
fR
⊤= (f∨id)⊤=f⊤∨id =f⊤R.
Corollary 5.1.3. A graph is transitive if and only if its transpose is transiti ve. Similarly, a graph is
reﬂexive if and only if its transpose is reﬂexive.
From Lemma 3.5.2, we have that the graph fisK-meet-nilpotent if and only if its transpose f⊤
isK-meet-nilpotent. However, a similar equivalence does not h old for asymptotic meet-nilpotence, as
the stairway to heaven is asymptotically meet-nilpotent, w hile its transpose the stairway to hell isn’t.
Sayfissymmetric iff=f⊤. The four examples of graphs given in Section 3 are all symmet ric;
the proof is simple and hence omitted.
Observation 5.1.4. A digraphDis symmetric if (u,v)∈Eimplies(v,u)∈E.
If the out-neighbourhood N=D⊤(v) is not empty, then vbelongs to the in-neighbourhood of
N:v∈D(N) =DD⊤(v). In more succinct terms, if D(V) =VthenDD⊤is reﬂexive. In general,
the in-neighbourhood of vsatisﬁesD(v)⊆DD⊤D(v) for any digraph Dand any vertex v. Those
two facts are generalised to graphs on complete Boolean alge bras as follows. For any graph f, let
fS=ff⊤; it is clear that fSis a symmetric graph.
Proposition 5.1.5. The following hold for any graph f:
(a)fSis reﬂexive if and only if f(1) =1;
(b)fSf≥f.
29Proof.For ally∈L, we have
f(y)∨f(¬y)∨¬f(1) =f(y∨¬y)∨¬f(1) =f(1)∨¬f(1) =1,
hence
f(y)≥ ¬(f(¬y)∨¬f(1)) =f∗(y)∧f(1).
Settingy=f⊤(x), we obtain
f(f⊤(x))≥f∗(f⊤(x))∧f(1) =f⊤+(f⊤(x))∧f(1)≥x∧f(1). (3)
Thus, iff(1) =1,fS(x)≥xfor allx∈L. Conversely, if f(1)<1, thenfS(1) =ff⊤(1)≤f(1)<1.
Moreover, setting x=f(u) in Equation (3) yields ff⊤f(u)≥f(u)∧f(1) =f(u).
If a digraph is both acyclic and symmetric, then it is empty. W e generalise this fact to ﬁxed
point-free graphs on complete Boolean algebras.
Corollary 5.1.6. LetLbe a complete Boolean algebra. Then the unique ﬁxed point-fre e symmetric
graph on Lis the empty graph.
Proof.Iff=f⊤, then letu=f(1). We have u≥f(u)≥f(f(u)), and by Equation (3), f(f(u))≥u,
thusu=f(u) =f(f(u)).
5.2 Dependencies and Boolean algebras
We now show that all four dependencies are equivalent for map pings over a Boolean algebra that
depend on graphs.
Theorem 5.2.1. LetLbe a complete Boolean algebra and φ:L→L. Letfbe a graph on L, then
the following are equivalent:
(1)φpre-meet-depends on f;
(2)φpre-join-depends on f∗;
(3)φpost-meet-depends on f+;
(4)φpost-join-depends on f⊤.
The rest of this subsection is devoted to the proof of Theorem 5.2.1.
Lemma 5.2.2. LetLbe a complete Boolean algebra, and x,y,a∈L. Thenx∧a=y∧aif and only
if¬x∧a=¬y∧a; similarly, x∨a=y∨aif and only if ¬x∨a=¬y∨a.
Proof.Supposex∧a=y∧a. Letz=x∧a∧¬y. We have
y∧a=x∧a=x∧a∧(y∨¬y) = (x∧a∧y)∨(x∧a∧¬y) = (y∧a)∨z.
Hencez≤y, andz≤ ¬y, thusz≤y∧¬y=0. Thusx∧a∧¬y=0and by symmetry ¬x∧a∧y=0.
We obtain
¬x∧a=¬x∧a∧(y∨¬y) = (¬x∧a∧y)∨(¬x∧a∧¬y) =¬x∧a∧¬y,
and by symmetry ¬y∧a=x∧a∧¬y. Thus¬x∧a=¬y∧a.
The proof of the second statement is similar and hence omitte d.
Lemma 5.2.3. LetLbe a complete Boolean algebra and φ,α,β,γ,δ :L→L. Then the following
hold.
(α)φpre-meet-depends on αif and only if φ∗pre-meet-depends on α.
(β)φpre-join-depends on βif and only if φ∗pre-join-depends on β.
30(γ)φpost-meet-depends on γif and only if φ∗post-meet-depends on γ.
(δ)φpost-join-depends on δif and only if φ∗post-join-depends on δ.
Proof.We only prove ( α); the other proofs are similar and hence omitted. We only hav e to prove one
implication; the other one follows from duality. If φpre-meet-depends on α, then for all x,y,s∈L,
x∧α(s) =y∧α(s) =⇒ ¬x∧α(s) =¬y∧α(s)
=⇒φ(¬x)∧s=φ(¬y)∧s
=⇒φ∗(x)∧s=φ∗(y)∧s.
Thusφ∗pre-meet-depends on α.
Lemma 5.2.4. LetLbe a complete Boolean algebra and φ,α,β,γ,δ :L→L. Then the following
hold.
(α) Ifφpre-meet-depends on α, thenφpre-join-depends on α∗.
(β) Ifφpre-join-depends on β, thenφpre-meet-depends on β∗.
(γ) Ifφpost-meet-depends on γ, thenφpost-join-depends on γ∗.
(δ) Ifφpost-join-depends on δ, thenφpost-meet-depends on δ∗.
Proof.Once again, we only prove ( α); the other proofs are similar and hence omitted. If φpre-meet-
depends on α, then for all x,y,s∈Lwe have
x∨α∗(s) =y∨α∗(s) =⇒ ¬x∧¬α∗(s) =¬y∧¬α∗(s)
=⇒ ¬x∧α(¬s) =¬y∧α(¬s)
=⇒φ(¬x)∧¬s=φ(¬y)∧¬s
=⇒ ¬φ(¬x)∨s=¬φ(¬y)∨s
=⇒φ∗(x)∨s=φ∗(y)∨s.
Thusφ∗pre-join-depends on α∗. By Lemma 5.2.3, φpre-join-depends on α∗as well.
Lemma 5.2.4 can be summarised as follows: φ(pre/post)-meet-depends on ψif and only if φ
(pre/post)-join-depends on ψ∗.
Lemma 5.2.5. LetLbe a complete Boolean algebra and φ,α,β,γ,δ :L→L. Then the following
hold.
(α) Ifφpost-join-depends on α⊤, thenφpre-meet-depends on α.
(β) Ifφpost-meet-depends on β⊥, thenφpre-join-depends on β.
(γ) Ifφpre-join-depends on γ⊥, thenφpost-meet-depends on γ.
(δ) Ifφpre-meet-depends on δ⊤, thenφpost-join-depends on δ.
Proof.Again, we only prove ( α); the other proofs are similar and hence omitted. Let β=α∗so that
α⊤=β−. Ifφpost-join-depends on β−, then by Lemma 4.1.4, φpre-join-depends on β. Then, by
Lemma 5.2.4, φpre-meet-depends on β∗=α.
Proof of Theorem 5.2.1. The proof follows from Lemma 5.2.5, where α=f,β=f∗,γ=f+, and
δ=f⊤.
Sincefpre-join-depends on f+, Lemma 5.2.4 shows that fpre-meet-depends on f⊤. In fact, the
dependency relations amongst f,f+,f∗, andf⊤are represented in Figure 12, where the head of each
arc depends on the tail of the arc. For instance, the fact that f⊤post-meet-depends on f+is the red
arc on the right.

5.3 Robert’s theorem for dependency on graphs over complete Boolean algebras
The statement of Robert’s theorem for pre-meet-dependency can be simpliﬁed further, depending on
whether Lis a frame – in which case αbeing pre-meet-covering is suﬃcient for convergence, or α
being a graph – in which case one can choose A= M(α+). We thus derive Robert’s theorem for
dependency on graphs over complete Boolean algebras in this subsection. Similarly to Section 4, we
shall give Robert’s theorem for complete Boolean algebras, study its tightness, and then reﬁne the
feedback bound. The overall picture for Robert’s theorem is depicted in Figure 13.
We begin this subsection by showing that a graph being pre-me et-complete is actually equivalent
to its transpose being asymptotically meet-nilpotent.
Proposition 5.3.1. LetLbe a complete Boolean algebra and fbe a graph, then the following are
equivalent:
(1)fis pre-meet-complete;
(2)f∗is pre-join-complete;
(3)f+is post-meet-complete, and equivalently asymptotically j oin-nilpotent;
(4)f⊤is post-join-complete, and equivalently asymptotically m eet-nilpotent.
Proof.Since a complete Boolean algebra is both a frame and a locale, by Proposition 4.2.4, a sequence
is meet/join-complete if and only if it is meet/join-coveri ng. As such, Proposition 4.2.6 holds if we
replace -covering by -complete everywhere. In particular, by item (α),fis pre-meet-complete if and
only iff+is asymptotically join-nilpotent, and by item ( γ), the latter is equivalent to f+being post-
meet-complete. By duality, fis pre-meet-complete if and only if f∗is pre-join-complete, and the rest
of the proof is similar as above.
We can now give Robert’s theorem for dependency on graphs ove r complete Boolean algebras. As
seen from Theorem 5.2.1, all four kinds of dependencies are e quivalent in this case, hence we only have
one statement.
Theorem 5.3.2 (Robert’s theorem for dependency on graphs over complete Bo olean algebras) .LetL
be a complete Boolean algebra, fbe a graph on Lwithf⊤asymptotically meet-nilpotent, and φ:L→L
pre-meet-depend on f. The following hold.
(a) There exists e∈Lsuch thate=⋀
iφi(x)∨fi
⊤(1)for allx∈Landφ։e.
(b) IffisK-meet-nilpotent, then e=φK(x)for allx∈L.
Proof. (a) By Theorem 5.2.1, φpost-join depends on f⊤, which is post-join-complete by Proposition
5.3.1. The result then follows from Theorem 2.2.1( δ)(c).

dotted arrows represent counterexamples, the green arrow represents an implication that holds
whenLis a power set lattice, while the black arrows represent unconditional implications.
(b) In this case, f⊤is alsoK-meet-nilpotent, and Theorem 2.2.1( δ)(d) concludes.
We now comment on the tightness of Robert’s theorem for compl ete Boolean algebras. We give
two counterexamples.
Firstly, we give a counterexample to: “If f⊤is asymptotically meet-nilpotent, then φK=e.”
Example 5.3.3. Letfbe the backwards ray and φ=f⊤be the ray. Then φpre-meet-depends on f,
andf⊤is not nilpotent.
Secondly, we give a counterexample to: “If f⊤is ﬁxed point-free, then Pyr( φ)⊆ {e}.”
Example 5.3.4. Letφbe the stairway to hell. Then φpre-meet-depends on the stairway to heaven
f, butf⊤=φis not asymptotically meet-nilpotent: |Pyr(φ)|= 2.
5.4 Fixed-point free graphs and the feedback bound
In [20], a digraph Dis called precarious if there exists a Boolean network φwith multiple ﬁxed points
(i.e. ahypodox)whichpost-join dependson D. They provethat adigraphis precarious if andonly if it
has an inﬁnite walk. In our terminology, that means Dis not ﬁxed point-free. We now generalise this
characterisation to all complete Boolean algebras; we also show reﬁne it by giving the corresponding
result for parabolic points.
We begin with a lemma that shall be used repeatedly in this sub section.
Lemma 5.4.1. LetLbe a complete Boolean algebra and x,y∈L. LetA={s∈L:x∨s=y∨s}
anda=⋀A. ThenA=a↑.
Proof.First,a∈Asince
x∨a=x∨⋀
A=⋀
x∨A=⋀
y∨A=y∨a.
Second, ifb≥a, then
x∨b=x∨a∨b=y∨a∨b=y∨b.
Theorem 5.4.2. LetLbe a complete Boolean algebra and fbe a graph on L. Then the following are
equivalent:
(1)f⊤is ﬁxed point-free;
(2)|Fix(φ)| ≤1wheneverφ:L→Lpre-meet-depends on f;
33(3)|Par(φ)| ≤1wheneverφ:L→Lpre-meet-depends on f.
Proof.(1) =⇒(2). Suppose x,y∈Fix(φ). LetA={s∈L:x∨s=y∨s}anda=⋀A. By Lemma
5.4.1,a∈A, hence we have the following chain of implications:
x∨a=y∨a=⇒φ(x)∨f⊤(a) =φ(y)∨f⊤(a) because φpost-join depends on f⊤
=⇒f⊤(a)≥a becausea=⋀
A
=⇒a=0 becausef⊤is ﬁxed-point free
=⇒x=y becausex∨a=y∨a.
(1) =⇒(3). In view of the previous implication, we only need to show that any parabolic point of
φis a ﬁxed point. Suppose x∈Par(φ), with (xi:i∈N) such that φ(xi) =xi−1for alli∈N1. Extend
this sequence to all Zwithx−i=φi(x) for alli∈N. For anyi∈Z, letDi={s∈L:xi∨s=xi−1∨s}
anddi=⋀Di. By Lemma 5.4.1, di∈Di, hence we have the following chain of implications:
xi∨di=xi−1∨di=⇒xi−1∨f⊤(di) =φ(xi−2)∨f⊤(di) because φpost-join depends on f⊤
=⇒f⊤(di)≥di−1 becausedi−1=⋀
Di−1.
LetD= (di:i∈Z), thenf⊤(⋁D)≥⋁D, thus⋁D=0. In particular, d0=0, which implies
x∈Fix(φ).
(3) =⇒(2). Trivial.
(2) =⇒(1). Iff⊤is not ﬁxed point-free, then φ=f⊤pre-meet-depends on f, and|Fix(φ)| ≥
2.
We now reﬁne the feedback bound for complete Boolean algebra s. Recall the deﬁnition of induced
subgraph from item (d) in Section 3.1. Say tis aﬁxed point-free set offiff⊤[t], the subgraph of
f⊤induced by t, is ﬁxed point-free.
Lemma 5.4.3. LetLbe a complete Boolean algebra and let fbe a graph on L. The following hold.
(a) Iftis a ﬁxed point-free set of f, then for any u≤t,f⊤(u)≥u=⇒u=0.
(b) Ifais a pre-meet-FVS of f, then¬ais a ﬁxed point-free set of f.
Proof. (a) We have the following set of equivalences:
f⊤[t] ﬁxed point-free ⇐⇒[f⊤(u)∧t≥u=⇒u=0∀u≤t]
⇐⇒[f⊤(u)≥u=⇒u=0∀u≤t].
(b) Letb=¬a, then the sequence B=¬Asatisﬁesb0=b,
f(ai)≤ai−1⇐⇒f∗(bi)≥bi−1⇐⇒f⊤−(bi)≥bi−1⇐⇒f⊤(bi−1)≤bi,
and⋀B=0. Therefore,⋀
ifi
⊤(b)≤⋀
ibi=0.
Ifc≤bandf⊤(c)≥c, then⋀
ifi
⊤(b)≥⋀
ifi
⊤(c)≥c,
which implies c=0, and hence bis a ﬁxed point-free set of f.
In view of Lemma 5.4.3 (b), the feedback bound for complete Bo olean algebras in Theorem 5.4.4
below is tighter than the one for complete lattices in Theore m 4.5.1.
34Theorem 5.4.4 (Feedback bound for dependency on graphs over complete Bool ean algebras) .Let
Lbe a complete Boolean algebra, fbe a graph on Landtbe an acyclic set of f. Ifφ:L→L
pre-meet-depends on f, then|Fix(φ)| ≤ |t↑|.
Proof.Supposex,y∈Fix(φ) such that x∨t=y∨t. LetA={s∈L:x∨s=y∨s}anda=⋀A.
First,a≤tsincet∈A. By Lemma 5.4.1, a∈A, hence we have the following chain of implications:
x∨a=y∨a=⇒x∨f⊤(a) =y∨f⊤(a) because φpost-join depends on f⊤
=⇒f⊤(a)≥a becausea=⋀
A
=⇒a=0 becausetis a ﬁxed point-free set of f
=⇒x=y becausex∨a=y∨a.
Therefore, if x∨t=y∨t, thenx=y. Thus, the mapping Fix( φ)→t↑that mapsxtox∨tis injective
and|Fix(φ)| ≤ |t↑|.
6 Applications to automata networks
6.1 Reviewing the original Robert theorem
Thedirect product of complete lattices is deﬁned as follows [18, Chapter I, Sec tion 3]. Let Vbe a
set, and for any v∈V, letLv= (Lv,∨v,∧v,0v,1v) be a complete lattice. Then their direct product
isL=∏
v∈VLvwithL= (L,∨,∧,0,1) is deﬁned as follows:
L=∏
v∈VLv={x= (xv∈Lv:v∈V)},
x∨y= (xv∨vyv:v∈V),
x∧y= (xv∧vyv:v∈V),
0= (0v:v∈V),
1= (1v:v∈V).
We note that the notation is consistent: 0= (0v:v∈V) and1= (1v:v∈V). We shall introduce
shorthand notations for any subset IofV, e.g.LI=∏
i∈ILi,xI= (xi:i∈I), etc.
LetL=∏
v∈VLv. Then an automata network is a mapping φ:L→L; aﬁnite automata
network is an automata network where Vis ﬁnite; a Boolean network is an automata network
where|Lv|= 2 for allv∈V.
DenotingT=∏
v∈V{0v,1v}, we have that T= (T,∨,∧,0,1) is isomorphic to the power set lattice
P(V).Tis a bi-topology, hence the mapping hfrom the proof of the bi-topology theorem deﬁned by
h(x) =⋀T∩x↓is a graph. More explicitly, we have
h(s)v={
0vifsv=0v,
1votherwise.
Then an interaction graph is any graph on Lof the form f=ghwheregis a graph on T. Therefore,
there is a one-to-one correspondence between interaction g raphs on Land digraphs on V.
The following proposition justiﬁes our terminology and sho ws that Theorem 4.3.1 is indeed a
generalisation of Robert’s original theorem.
Proposition 6.1.1. LetL=∏
v∈VLvas above. If f:L→Lis an interaction graph on L, then
there exists a digraph DonVsuch thatφ:L→Lpre-meet-depends on fif and only if φdepends on
D.
Proof.LetT=∏
v∈V{0v,1v}, then there is a bijection τ:P(V)→Twhereτ(a) = (1a,0¬a). We
remark that for all x∈L,x∧τ(a) = (xa,0¬a). Letf=ghbe an interaction graph on Land let
D=τ−1gτbe the corresponding digraph on V.
35We then have the following chain of equivalences:
φdepends on D⇐⇒[
xD(a)=yD(a)=⇒φ(x)a=φ(y)a∀a⊆V]
⇐⇒[x∧gτ(a) =y∧gτ(a) =⇒φ(x)∧τ(a) =φ(y)∧τ(a)∀a⊆V]
⇐⇒[x∧g(t) =y∧g(t) =⇒φ(x)∧t=φ(y)∧t∀t∈T]
⇐⇒[x∧gh(s) =y∧gh(s) =⇒φ(x)∧h(s) =φ(y)∧h(s)∀s∈L].(4)
Sinceh(s)≥s, the property in the RHS of (4) clearly implies
x∧gh(s) =y∧gh(s) =⇒φ(x)∧s=φ(y)∧s∀s∈L, (5)
whichinturnisequivalent to φpre-meet-dependingon f. Conversely, since hisidempotent, restricting
(5) toh(s) implies the property in the RHS of (4).
6.2 Beyond the original Robert theorem
The so-called converse of the complete Banach contraction p rincipleshows that if a mappingconverges
to a unique ﬁxed point, then it is contractive for some metric [4]. The bounded Banach contraction
principle has a similar converse [19]. Instead of searching for a converse of Robert’s theorem in general,
we show it for the ﬁnite case below. So far, we placed on X=QVthe structure of a direct product
of lattices, but by using a diﬀerent lattice structure (namel y, a chain) we prove that any nilpotent
mappingφ:X→Xpre-meet-depends on a meet-nilpotent graph.
Theorem 6.2.1. LetXbe a ﬁnite set and φ:X→XbeK-nilpotent. Then there exists a lattice L
onXand aK-meet-nilpotent graph f:X→XonLsuch thatφpre-meet-depends on f.
Proof.Letebe the unique ﬁxed point of φ. For allx∈X, letd(x) = min{k:φk(x) =e}; for all
0≤i≤K, letSi={x∈X:d(x) =k}. We note that S0={e}and that if x∈Sifor somei≥1,
thenφ(x)∈Si−1. For any 1 ≤i≤K, letUi=φ(Si+1)⊆SiandTi=Si\Ui, so thatTK=SK. The
linear order is given by:
•S0>T1>U1>···>TK>UK(whereA<Bindicatesa<bfor alla∈Aandb∈Bfor any
A,B⊆X);
•Tiis ordered with “consecutive pre-images”, i.e. if a < b∈Tisatisfyφ(a) =φ(b), then
φ(c) =φ(a) for alla<c<b ;
•Uiinherits the order of Si+1, i.e. ifa<b∈Si+1, thenφ(a)≤φ(b).
LetLbe the lattice on Xinduced by that linear order. We now prove that φis monotone.
Supposea < b. Ifd(a)> d(b), then either d(φ(a))> d(φ(b)) and hence φ(a)< φ(b), orb=eand
henceφ(a) =φ(b) =e. Ifd(a) =d(b), thena,b∈Si+1for somei≥0, and hence by deﬁnition
φ(a)≤φ(b).
Sinceφis monotone and ﬁxes e=1, and since Lis a ﬁnite chain, φis a co-graph by Proposition
3.1.2. Letf=φ−. Sinceφis a co-graph, fis a graph by Theorem 3.2.3(a), fisK-meet-nilpotent by
Lemma 3.5.2(b), and φpre-meet-depends on fby Figure 6.
Below is an example of a nilpotent mapping φthat does not satisfy the consequence of the original
Robert’s theorem (and hence does not satisfy the hypothesis either). Indeed, φis (q−1)-nilpotent,
even though |V|= 2. However, φpre-meet-depends on a graph fsuch thatfq−1(1) =0, and hence
φq−1(x) =efor allx. Obviously, this example can be vastly generalised to yield nilpotence with
arbitrarily long trajectories.
Example 6.2.2. We consider L=∏
v∈VLvwhereV={1,2}andL1=L2is the chain 0<1<
···< q−1. For anya∈ {0,...,q−1}, leta+= min{q−1,a+ 1}anda−= max{0,a−1}. Let
x= (x1,x2)∈Land deﬁne the automata network φby
φ(x1,x2) = (x+
1,x+
2).
36Thenφis(q−1)-join-nilpotent but not K-join-nilpotent for any K <q−1. Note that the interaction
graph ofφis reﬂexive. However, since φis a co-graph, it pre-meet-depends on the graph f=φ−,
given explicitly by
f(x1,x2) = (x−
1,x−
2).
This example is illustrated for q= 4in Figure 14.

Finally, the original Robert’s theorem for ﬁnite automata n etworks can be recast as follows: If
there exists a sequence S0=∅,S1,...,S K=Vof subsets of Vsuch that
xSi=ySi=⇒φ(x)Si+1=φ(y)Si+1
for alli≤K−1, thenφK=e, its unique ﬁxed point. (In Robert’s theorem, Si=Gφ+i(∅).) This idea
can be easily generalised to any complete lattice and any ﬁni te sequence beginning at 0and ﬁnishing
at1.
Proposition 6.2.3. LetLbe a complete lattice. If there exists a sequence A= (a0=0,a1,...,aK=
1)of elements of Lsuch that
x∧ai=y∧ai=⇒φ(x)∧ai+1=φ(y)∧ai+1
for all0≤i≤K−1, thenφK=ewithFix(φ) ={e}.
Proof.The proof is by straightforward induction. Alternatively, deﬁneα:L→Lby
α(x) ={
aiifx=ai+1,i<K
1otherwise.
Thenφpre-meet-depends on α, andαisK-meet-nilpotent, hence φK=e.
7 Conclusion
This paper made two main contributions: the generalisation of a “graph theory” for mappings on
complete lattices, and the generalisation of Robert’s theo rem in the same context. As such, this work
can be expanded in two major ways.
Firstly, one could further develop this sort of graph theory for complete lattices. For instance, one
could deﬁne further concepts from digraphs, such as dominat ing set (x∈Lsuch thatfR(x) =1),
37total dominating set ( f(x) =1), independent set ( f(x)∧x=0), etc. Moreover, we saw that induced
subgraphs could be deﬁned for frames, while transpose graph s could be deﬁned for complete Boolean
algebras. In general, diﬀerent classes of complete lattices inherit diﬀerent concepts from digraphs, and
hence yield distinct graph theories with various degrees of richness.
Secondly, we have given boundson ﬁxed points (and even pyram idal points) of automata networks.
However, we know that the interaction graph has a strong inﬂu ence on other dynamical properties
of ﬁnite automata networks, such as the rank (see [10]). It wo uld be very interesting to generalise
the results on ﬁnite automata networks based on the interact ion graph to our setting. Moreover, an
automata network also has a signed interaction graph, which indicates whether an inﬂuence is positive
(excitation) or negative (inhibition) or both (this is typi cally the case in linear networks). The signed
interaction graph has a strong inﬂuence on the dynamics of ﬁn ite automata networks, see for example
[2, 1, 23, 24, 3, 25]. Our framework based on lattices does not seem appropriate to handle signed
interaction graphs, especially the case where one entity ca n simultaneously excite a second entity and
inhibit a third one. As such, developing a diﬀerent or more gen eral framework to encompass the signed
interaction graph is an important avenue for future work in t his area.
