Abstract.  Giving rewards is one of the efforts made to increase the motivation of PAUD Teacher 
to build better performance in educating early childhood. In this study we used a decision support 
system using the MOORA method to dete rmine the best PAUD Teacher who is entitled to 
rewards without any jealousy from other unselected candidates. On the results of the alternative research Alexander Putra (A1) has a Yi Preference value of 0.4547, Siti Aisyah (A2) has an Yi Prefecture value o f 0.04245, Amany Putri (A3) has the Yi Preférence value Of 0.4165, Inggrit 
(A5) has a value of 0,4104, and Asri Sulistya (A4) has a 0.4022 value. So the final result on the 
determination of the best PAUD teacher using the MOORA method in this study Alexander Putra 
(A1) who has the highest value among all other alternatives was chosen as the best MAUD teacher . 
Keywords:  Decision Support System, Best PAUD Teacher, MOORA .
 
1 Introduction 
PAUD (Early Child Education) is a training program aimed at newborn children up to the age of 6 (six) 
years by providing educational stimulation to support the growth, physical development, and spiritual development of children so that they are ready to continue to the next level of education [1] . At the Early 
Childhood Education (PAUD) level, teachers have a very important role to build children's character well from 
an early age [2] . PAUD teachers are tasked with educating early childhood through the development of 
personality and desired values, one of them is the application of learning using the dimension of play while 
learning [3]. 
Evaluation activities for PAUD teachers are an activity that is commonly carried out in the world of 
education. The evaluation process aims to determine the performance of PAUD teachers and the quality they 
have while carrying out their duties in providing education to students. Through the performance appraisal 
activities carried out, rewards can be applied to PAUD teachers who have the best achievements. So that it can motivate other PAUD teachers to be able to provide better loyalty in the future [4] . The determination of the 
best PAUD teacher is not an easy thing, if the wrong decision is made then it can cause the occurrence of jealousy among other candidates who are not elected while having a better performance than the candidate who is elected as a recipient of rewards. Therefore, it is very  necessary to have a well -computerized system to 
support the accurate decision -making process in determining the best PAUD teacher.  
Decision Support System (DSS) is an interactive information system that can provide information, modeling, 
and data manipulation to help decision makers to solve problems in semi -structured and unstructured situations 
[5–8]. One method that can be implemented into a Decision Support System (DSS) is the MOORA (Multi -
Objective Optimization on The Basis of Ratio Analysis) method  [9–11]. 
The MOORA method is a multiobjective optimizing system that can have two or more attributes that are not 
related. The MOORA method was first introduced by a scientist named Braurers in 2004 to solve various problems in making difficult decisions  [12]. Since  its introduction by Braurers, MOORA has been widely used 
to solve decision- making problems to provide accurate and reliable results  [13]. In Muhammad Fachrizal 
Anshary et al.'s research, it was concluded that the MOORA method has a good level of selectivity for solving decision -making problems with conflicting criteria  [14]. Sriwahyuni Hutagalung et al. In his research, he said 
that the MOORA method could simplify the decision- making process by ranking accurate alternatives  [15].

the figure below : 
   
 
    
 
    
 
Figure 1. Research Stage 
Information: a. Field Study  
In this first stage, a field study process was carried out at the research location. At this stage the authors conducted interviews with informants at the intended research location to obtain data samples for determining the best PAUD teachers that had been completed previously using direc t assessment from 
their leaders . 
b. Literature review  
In this second stage, the process of collecting literature data related to the theory of Decision Support System s (DSS), the Multi- Objective Optimization on The Basis of Ratio Analysis (MOORA) method, 
PAUD Teachers (Early Childhood Education), and other theories discussed by the author in this research. 
c. Method Implementation  
In this third stage, the process of imple menting the Multi- Objective Optimization on The Basis of Ratio 
Analysis (MOORA) method is carried out to solve decision- making problems in de termining the best 
PAUD teacher.  
d. Making Conclusions  
In this fourth stage, conclusions were drawn from the results and discussion related to solving the 
problem of determining the best PAUD Teacher with a Decision Support System (SPK) using Multi -
Objective Optimization on The Basis of Ratio Analysis (MOORA) which was completed in this study. 
2.2 Metode Multi -Objective Optimization on The Basis of Ratio Analysis (MOORA)  
The steps carried out in the MOORA method to solve decision- making problems are [16] : 
a. Matrix Value Determination  
The process of determining the matrix value in the MOORA method is carried out using the following 
formula:  
𝑋𝑋=  �𝑋𝑋11𝑋𝑋12𝑋𝑋1𝑛𝑛
𝑋𝑋21𝑋𝑋22𝑋𝑋2𝑛𝑛
𝑋𝑋31𝑋𝑋32𝑋𝑋3𝑛𝑛�             (1) 
b. Matrix Normalization  
After getting the matrix value, the matrix normalization process is carried out in the MOORA method using the following formula:  
X∗𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖=𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖/��∑𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖2𝑚𝑚
𝑖𝑖=1�                (2) 
c. Optimizing Attributes  
For multi- objective optimization, the normalized size is added when the attribute is favorable, and the 
normalized size is reduced when the attribute is unfavorable.  Field Study

 Y𝑖𝑖=∑−∑𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑥𝑥 𝑛𝑛
𝑖𝑖=𝑔𝑔+1𝑔𝑔
𝑖𝑖=1             (3) 
Where G is the number of attributes to be maximiz ed, (n -g) is the number of attributes to be minimized, 
yi is the value of the normalized assessment results in alternative 1 for all attributes. After taking into account the weigh t attribute, equation 4 becomes : 
Y𝑖𝑖=∑𝑊𝑊𝑖𝑖𝑋𝑋1𝑖𝑖∗−∑𝑊𝑊𝑖𝑖𝑊𝑊𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖∗ 𝑛𝑛
𝑖𝑖=𝑔𝑔+1𝑔𝑔
𝑖𝑖=1            (4) 
d. Ranking Results  
The Yi value can be positive or negative depending on the maximum and minimum values that have been obtained in the decision matrix. The order of the ranking results, Yi represents the final choice. The best solution has the highest Yi value and the worst solution has the lowest Yi value. From the ranking results 
obtained, an alternative that has the highest Yi value will be determined as the best PAUD teacher .
